      "\n",
      "The 33-year-old SBF famously went from trading billions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency to peddling commissary ramen packs after a massive federal investigation uncovered rampant fraud perpetuated by his blockchain company, FTX. His sentence is 25 years followed by three years of supervised release, which began in March of 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wall Street Journal reports that SBF was awakened at 3 am from his cot in the Brooklyn Metropolitan Correctional Center and carted off to a facility in Oklahoma City, which typically serves as a holding place for incarcerated people in transit to their long-term destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether the change of scenery was a punishment for the Carlson appearance or a coincidence isn't yet known. Prior to SBF's arrest, he had scrawled a fallout plan with contingencies like \"come out as extremely pro crypto, pro freedom,\" and \"go on Tucker Carlsen [sic], come out as [R]epublican.\" He seems to be pushing that latter vision hard lately, in a possible bid to get the attention of president Donald Trump, whose second term is coming with a slew of crypto-friendly policies and pardons.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Carlson interview, SBF pushed a narrative familiar to the second Trump administration, claiming he was punished harshly because of his donations and growing ties to the GOP in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One fact that might be relevant is, in 2020 I was center-left, and I gave to Biden's campaign,\" SBF told Tucker. \"I spent the next few years in DC a lot. I made dozens of trips there, and was really, really shocked by what I saw there, and not in a good direction. By late 2022 I was giving privately to Republicans privately, as much as Democrats, and that started becoming known right around FTX's collapse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "SBF had previously used his social media account — via posts \"shared with a friend\" — to send his sympathies to Elon Musk's DOGE as it rips through the federal government to the widespread ire of taxpayers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Firing people is one of the hardest things to do in the world,\" he wrote. \"It sucks for everyone involved... but there’s no point in keeping them around, doing nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Where SBF ends up now is anyone's guess. People close to him have previously told CNN they believe he's being sent to Mendota, California, a close drive to his parent's home in Stanford, where Bankman-Fried grew up. Until then, he'll have plenty of time to reflect on his crimes from within the sixth-poorest state in the country. If nothing else, maybe they can school him on some of that middle-American work ethic.\n",

The White House clarified later that the formula it used was based on just two variables: the U.S.\\'s trade deficit with a foreign country divided by that country\\'s exports to the U.S.What To KnowSNL mocked Trump\\'s \"historically awesome speech\" in the Rose Garden at the White House, with James Austin Johnson acting as the president.The numbers mean \"we\\'re gonna make America wealthy again—MAWA,\" he said. \"You know, you\\'re gonna check your stock portfolio in a couple of days and think \\'I\\'m almost too wealthy.\\' We\\'re doing MAWA.\"But before that, we\\'re doing MAGDA—Make America Great Depression Again—it\\'ll be better than great, it\\'ll be a fantastic, unbelievable Great Depression the likes of which you\\'ve never seen before.

Low and slow, you\\'ve gotta braise him, you know.\"This was a reference to last September, when Springfield, Ohio, became the center of a political firestorm after unfounded rumors spread that Haitian migrants had been killing pets and park birds for food.City officials quickly debunked these stories, but they were repeated by Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk.Who Played Trump, Musk on \\'SNL\\'?Johnson, who has been a cast member of SNL since 2021, played Trump.

After we posted The GraphicTM (you know the one), I hosted a weeklong strategy retreat with the full DNC social team—where we rebuilt not just our content priorities, but our mindset/approach to approvals,” she wrote.\\n\\n“We received over 135M impressions across accounts during the month of March, and we’re going to do more—and better—in April and the months to come,” Mangubat continued.\\n\\nShe is not the only staffer from the DNC noting a vibe shift.\\n\\n“I manage the supporter feedback inbox for @TheDemocrats and when I tell y’all the vibes haven’t been this good in a minute,” wrote another staffer on X. “Dems are inspired! Dems are hopeful!”\\n\\nThe updates come after a failed “Here’s what Democrats did in February” graphic that contained 32 bullet points of long sentences that instantly received backlash.\\n\\nThe post on X hit 2.6 million views. The comment section took off as hundreds of people slammed the social media team saying “no one is going to read that” or “who the f*** gets paid to do this.”\\n\\nThe DNC is not the only Democratic account that has received flack. Congressional Democrats pretending to be video game characters in “choose your fighter” parody videos were slammed by the right, saying they were “out of touch” and “missed the mark” with the trend.\\n\\nSammy Kanter, a Democratic consultant and influencer, noted the DNC is being transparent with the public on its changes. \\n\\nThe new donkey profile picture “marked a turning point of seeing where their strategy was going to go,” Kanter told the Washington Examiner. “I think that tweet was interesting of them sharing that they get feedback from every corner of the internet, which I’m glad that they’re doing social listening and seeing what some of that feedback is.”\\n\\nKanter noted the party previously kept their socials “corporate,” but now they are “experimenting with strategy.” Kanter pointed out the success of the Kamala HQ account with its “funny and relatable” nature.\\n\\nIn light of this sentiment, the DNC poached veterans of the Kamala HQ account in their latest effort to push rapid response, Axios reported. \\n\\nThe new account @FactPostNews is the latest push for the party to combat misinformation while responding to the Trump administration in an entertaining way. Those running this account are many of the same people who ran Harris’s popular social media accounts in 2024.\\n\\n“I think Dems need to cut the safety rope,” Kanter continued. “This is, as per usual, unprecedented times, but I just think that sort of safety approach clearly hasn’t been working, so you might as well be yourself or say what you think.”\\n\\nCutting the safety rope and posting quick-witted responses has proven to work for the account last month, with one post in response to a Tesla Cybertruck reaching 11 million views merely noting “ugly a** truck.” \\n\\nRight-wing media has thrived in taking the “cutting the safety rope” approach. From podcasts like Joe Rogan to accounts such as @libsoftiktok, these accounts amplify the punchy approach. Aside from right-wing content creators, Elon Musk’s ownership of X and whopping following of 218 million helps spread the president’s agenda. \\n\\nAlong with tightening up their social strategy to meet the moment and gain traction, Democrats celebrated wins across the country this week.\\n\\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) broke the record Tuesday for the longest floor speech at 25 hours and four minutes where he protested Trump and Musk’s agenda to reach those in the party who feel like Democrats are not pushing back. \\n\\nThe senator did not eat or use the bathroom for the entirety of the speech and was only alleviated from speaking when other Democratic senators asked questions. He broke the record for the late Sen. Strom Thurmond’s filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. \\n\\nFollowing breaking the record, Booker appeared on MSNBC with Rachel Maddow but was also interviewed by liberal internet star Aaron Parnas, further reflecting Democrats’ new strategy of lawmakers meeting with content creators.\\n\\nAnother win for Democrats came when the Senate passed Sen. Tim Kaine’s (D-VA) resolution, with some GOP support, to halt Trump’s ability to impose tariffs on Canada just mere hours after the president unveiled his “liberation day” tariffs. Although the resolution will go nowhere in the House, the passage with GOP support marked the first signs of a legislative success in pushing back against Trump’s agenda. \\n\\nPerhaps the biggest win for the party this week was when Judge Susan Crawford prevailed in Wisconsin for the state Supreme Court race, cementing the liberal majority of the court after Musk poured tens of millions into this race against Crawford. \\n\\nWhile voter turnout was small on Tuesday compared to a presidential election, more than half a million more voters turned out for this Supreme Court race than the state’s last one in 2023, indicating that voters are engaged and ready to participate. \\n\\nAOC TAKES EARLY LEAD OVER SCHUMER IN NEW YORK SENATE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY: POLL\\n\\nWhile the Democratic Party has a long way to go leading up to the 2026 midterm elections, social media strategy will be crucial in elections moving forward. \\n\\n“I think TV is now going to the wayside in the new frontier of politics and social media and Trump dominates on social media, and so now he’s dominating the political space,” Gen Z Rep.

Investors speculated that a looser regulatory environment -- and CEO Elon Musk\\'s closeness with Trump and his inner circle -- could pave the way for Tesla to bring its autonomous driving and humanoid robotics platforms to market more quickly.\\n\\nAccording to Musk, these products could make Tesla the most valuable company in the world one day -- in fact, he thinks there is a possibility it could be worth more than the next five largest companies combined. Today, those five companies would be Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet, which are worth a combined $12.9 trillion. \\n\\nBut there\\'s a glaring problem which has already sent Tesla stock plunging by 41% from its December record high: The company is experiencing a sharp decline in its electric vehicle (EV) sales, which still account for most of its revenue. Here\\'s why Tesla stock could buck Musk\\'s prediction and deliver more downside instead.\\n\\nTesla\\'s first-quarter delivery numbers are in, and they aren\\'t good\\n\\nTesla used to be the world\\'s largest EV brand by sales, but China-based BYD snatched the throne by delivering more cars in the last two consecutive quarters. People appear to be choosing cheaper options like BYD\\'s Seagull EV, which sells for just $10,000 in its domestic market, and is now moving into other regions, including Europe. Tesla simply can\\'t compete at that price point.\\n\\nBut the rise of other EV manufacturers is only part of the story. The Tesla brand also appears to be losing some of its shine organically, because it failed to grow sales during 2024. The company delivered 1.79 million cars for the year, which was a 1% decline compared to 2023. The result came just one year after Musk told investors he planned to grow EV production by 50% per year for the foreseeable future -- which simply isn\\'t possible if the cars aren\\'t selling.\\n\\nThis year is is shaping up to be even worse. Tesla just revealed that it delivered 336,681 EVs during the first quarter (ended March 31), which was a whopping 13% decline compared to the year-ago period. The number was also significantly below Wall Street\\'s average forecast of 377,590, which analysts had already revised down in the weeks leading up to the official release. \\n\\nMusk\\'s involvement in global politics seems to be a key reason why many people are steering clear of Tesla. There have been growing reports of violence against Tesla dealerships and privately owned vehicles over the last few months, not just in the U.S., but also across Europe. Musk\\'s leadership role in the Department of Government Efficiency -- an external group that\\'s working with the U.S. government to cut what it calls \"wasteful\" spending to reduce the national debt -- is especially divisive among Americans.\\n\\nTesla\\'s long-term catalysts could be more valuable than the EV business\\n\\nTesla has a market capitalization of $886 billion as of this writing, making it three times more valuable than Toyota, despite selling 83% fewer cars last year. Simply put, Tesla\\'s valuation isn\\'t grounded in the realities of its EV business right now. Instead, investors are focusing on a series of future products that haven\\'t actually hit the market yet.\\n\\nOne of them is the Cybercab, which is designed to run on the company\\'s full self-driving (FSD) software. Tesla\\'s goal is to establish a ride-hailing network where its robotaxis can autonomously haul passengers and earn revenue for the company around the clock (like Uber, except without human drivers). Tesla\\'s FSD software isn\\'t approved for unsupervised use on American roads just yet, but Musk is hopeful it will be active in Texas and California sometime this year.\\n\\nThere are some substantial expectations for the Cybercab on Wall Street. Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities thinks autonomous vehicles represent a trillion-dollar opportunity for Tesla, and Cathie Wood\\'s Ark Investment Management predicts that autonomous ride-hailing alone will catapult the company to a $8 trillion valuation by 2029. \\n\\nBut Musk is eyeing an even bigger opportunity: humanoid robots. He believes they will outnumber humans by 2040 as we defer repetitive jobs, dangerous tasks, and even household chores to them. Tesla plans to build several thousand of its Optimus humanoid robots during 2025, but Musk thinks annual production could top 100 million units in the coming years. \\n\\nIt\\'s unclear whether demand will ramp up equally fast, but nevertheless, Musk recently told investors that Optimus could bring in a mind-boggling $10 trillion in revenue over the long term. \\n\\nTesla stock could plunge by another 70%\\n\\nAs bright as Tesla\\'s long-term future might be, EV sales still account for 79% of the company\\'s revenue, so the recent declines are going to have highly negative effects on its financial results. Tesla\\'s 2024 earnings per share (EPS) plunged by 53% to $2.04 on the back of the modest decline in EV sales last year, so its bottom line could take an even bigger hit in 2025 should the company not improve on its delivery numbers. \\n\\nTesla stock trades at an eye-popping price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 130.9. That makes it four times as expensive as the Nasdaq-100 index, which hosts most of Tesla\\'s big-tech peers and trades at a P/E ratio of just 29.2. It\\'s also significantly more expensive than Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet. \\n\\nTSLA PE Ratio data by YCharts.\\n\\nIn order for Tesla to become more valuable than all five of those companies combined (as Musk predicts), its stock would have to soar by 1,350% from where it trades as of this writing. Its current P/E ratio makes that practically impossible, especially if the company\\'s EPS continues to shrink -- which is likely if its EV sales continue to head south.\\n\\nProducts like the Cybercab and Optimus aren\\'t expected to go into mass production until 2026 or later, which means Tesla has to find a way to buoy its EV business for at least the next couple of years. Unfortunately, it\\'s facing so many headwinds -- from brand damage to competition -- that righting the ship could take a significant amount of time.\\n\\nI don\\'t think Tesla\\'s upcoming products will come to market fast enough to offset its floundering EV business, which is why I believe its stock is likely to plummet from here.

That’s what we tell ourselves.\\n\\nBut behind all the bile and hyperbole spewing from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., there are actually some outright stupid (if not incredibly dangerous) ideas being floated that could seriously damage our country. Today, I’d like to look at some of the loose talk regarding the U.S. Postal Service.\\n\\nI’ll start by directing you to a report titled “USPS Privatization: A Framework,” dated Feb. 27 of this year and issued by the equity research department at Wells Fargo. You might remember Wells Fargo in connection with a credit scandal that broke about 10 years ago; some geniuses in its sales department thought it would be a good idea to “invent” tens of thousands of imaginary accounts to bolster the company’s balance sheets. The problem was that these imaginary accounts were drawn up in actual people’s names. About 85,000 people had a combined total of $2 million in account fees tacked on to their credit reports.\\n\\nFortunately, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau stepped in and helped to correct the situation. I mention the CFPB here because (also in February of this year), Trump & Co. gutted the leadership of the agency and then turned Elon Musk loose on it. If we get into any trouble from Trump’s many financial plans for America, please don’t look to the CFPB for any help.\\n\\nBack to the report. Wells Fargo acknowledges that it will take legislation to move forward with privatization and that the chances of that type of bill passing through Congress on its own are essentially zero. Instead, the authors propose to tack it on to a piece of “must-pass” legislation, like the federal budget, and sneak it into the Congressional Record.\\n\\nIn layman’s terms, this is called blackmail. We all get something we like (continued government function) while Wall Street gets to carve up a tasty federal asset.\\n\\nBut it’s really not that tasty of an asset. The report highlights the idea of “harvesting” an estimated $85 billion of value in Postal Service real estate but neglects to mention that the Postal Service rents almost three-quarters of its facilities. Those rents are known as liabilities in the financial world and Wells Fargo does not mention how they are to be paid for.\\n\\nThe chief liability the report mentions is about $400 billion of pension and health care obligations that the USPS has to its employees. That sounds like a lot — until you consider that the Postal Service has about $300 billion in assets to put toward it. Yeah, I know, $100 billion is still a big chunk of change, even more so when you read the part of the report where Wells Fargo proposes shouldering the taxpayer with it.\\n\\nAlso on the liability side, the report also fails to mention a financial term called “deferred maintenance.” Allow me to explain this. If a company has up-to-date equipment and a well-trained workforce, the owner will probably not sell it. Instead, he or she will continue to operate and reap the financial benefits of doing so.\\n\\nIf a company has a 30-35-year-old fleet of vehicles, inventory software from the 1980s and a high rate of employee turnover (like the Postal Service), you can probably buy it on the cheap, but you’ll have to pay for some costly upgrades and modernization. This is called deferred maintenance. Don’t look for an explanation of it in the Wells Fargo report; it isn’t there.\\n\\nYes, the Postal Service has its problems. As a former business executive turned rural carrier, I see them every day. But there are a lot of ways to solve them without gutting the institution. Wells Fargo does point out that USPS’s delivery rates are too low and could be raised by over 100% in some cases. This would be a good start. Ridding the management of political toadies would also help — micromanagement by the government is the cause of most of the Postal Service’s present difficulties.\\n\\nThe key thing is to focus on enhancing the one thing that Wells Fargo forgets and that I haven’t mentioned yet — the very high degree of public trust that the USPS has always enjoyed. That’s why I went to work for the Postal Service and, if I can distract my boss from the op-ed page, I look forward to continuing to do so.', category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-06 08:00:41', authors=['Jack McKinney']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Houston’s 50501 Movement Rally was a huge success, especially given the forecast for inclement weather.

But none have fallen more sharply than Tesla (TSLA -10.39%). The stock is down 50% from its record high.\\n\\nHowever, senior research analyst Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities recently told Bloomberg that Tesla could be a $2 trillion company within 24 months. That forecast implies 160% upside from its current market value of $770 billion and a share price above $620.\\n\\nHere\\'s what investors should know about Tesla.\\n\\nTesla is losing market share in electric cars, and Elon Musk\\'s politics are a problem\\n\\nTesla accounted for 17% of battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales in 2024, down from 19% in 2023. And market share losses have accelerated this year due to increased competition and CEO Elon Musk\\'s involvement in politics. Tesla accounted for just 12% of BEV sales year to date through February, while Chinese automaker BYD took the top spot with 15% market share.\\n\\nLikewise, in the first quarter of 2025, Tesla deliveries declined to the lowest level since Q2 2022, another sign that demand is deteriorating. The company plans to launch a more affordable vehicle in the first half of 2025, which may help to some degree, but the more pressing issue is Musk becoming a political figure. He has undoubtedly upset potential buyers and may have tarnished the Tesla brand.\\n\\nDemocrats recently targeted Musk in Wisconsin with advertising that claimed, \"Elon Musk is out of control, and now the power hungry billionaire is unloading millions to buy the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\" Ads that paint Musk as callous or even villainous may become increasingly common as the 2026 midterm elections approach, and that could dissuade some consumers from supporting his companies.\\n\\nIn short, Musk has put Tesla in the political crosshairs, and investors must ask themselves whether they are comfortable with that risk. Musk already manages several companies yet chose to take on additional work with the Department of Government Efficiency. Is he too distracted to run Tesla? Would Tesla be OK (or even better off) if Musk was less involved? Those are difficult questions to answer.\\n\\nHowever, Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley recently reiterated his bullish outlook for Tesla. He recently wrote, \"We believe the challenges facing Tesla\\'s current business are widely reported and well known, while the opportunities in the future business are potentially greatly underestimated.\"\\n\\nTesla has a massive opportunity in physical artificial intelligence\\n\\nPhysical artificial intelligence (AI) is the technology that allows machines like autonomous cars and robots to understand and interact with the real world. Dan Ives says autonomous driving technology alone is a $1 trillion opportunity for Tesla. The company plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, this June, followed by several other U.S. cities by year-end.\\n\\nCitigroup estimates autonomous humanoid robot sales will reach $209 billion by 2035 and $7 trillion by 2050, up from zero in 2025. Musk says Tesla has the \"best team of humanoid robotics engineers in the world.\" The company debuted its Optimus prototype in 2022 and plans to use the robot internally this year. It may begin selling Optimus to other companies as early as the second half of 2026.\\n\\nMusk believes autonomous driving technology and robotics could eventually make Tesla the most valuable company in the world, perhaps worth even more than the next five companies combined. But there is a great deal of execution risk baked into that prediction. Alphabet\\'s Waymo has been providing autonomous rides to consumers for several years, so Tesla is already behind the curve.\\n\\nTesla stock looks expensive today, but it may appear cheaper in hindsight\\n\\nTesla stock has tumbled 50% from its record high as investors have become concerned by weak demand and disappointing performance metrics. The company has yet to announce financial results for the first quarter, but the numbers will likely be dismal after deliveries fell to the lowest level in nearly three years.\\n\\nAdditionally, Wall Street expects the company\\'s adjusted earnings to grow at 20% annually through 2026. That consensus makes the current valuation of 100 times adjusted earnings look absurdly expensive. However, it fails to account for a possible acceleration in earnings as the company monetizes robotaxis and Optimus.\\n\\nFor instance, Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley believes robotaxis could add $17 billion to the bottom line by 2035. Comparatively, the company reported non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income of $8.4 billion last year. So, Jonas believes autonomous ride-sharing services will become a substantial source of profit over the next decade. If he is correct, the stock may appear cheap in hindsight.\\n\\nPersonally, I agree with Dan Ives that Tesla could potentially achieve a $2 trillion market value within two years. However, I believe Musk needs to refocus on the company sooner rather than later for that to happen. Tesla must scale its robotaxi business as quickly as possible because Waymo already has a head start.', category=None, publish_date='2025-04-06 07:30:00', authors=['Trevor Jennewine']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Saturday Night Live takes aim at Trump;s tariffs and Tesla backlash in wild cold open, coining “MAGDA&quot; – Make America Great Depression Again – and unveiling a self-vandalizing Tesla.', image='https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/931/523/trump-snl.png?ve=1&tl=1', sentiment=0.016, language='en', video=None, title=\"SNL skit takes aim at Trump’s tariffs and Tesla vandalism: 'Make America Great Depression Again'\", url='https://www.foxnews.com/media/snl-skit-takes-aim-trumps-tariffs-tesla-vandalism-make-america-great-depression-again', source_country='us', id=308173828, text='\"Saturday Night Live\" took aim at President Donald Trump’s new tariff policy and the growing backlash against Tesla in a biting political sketch this weekend, coining a new phrase to mock the president’s economic outlook: MAGDA — \"Make America Great Depression Again.\" \"We’re [going to] do MAGDA,\" said cast member James Austin Johnson, reprising his role as Trump. \"Make America Great Depression Again.

Across DHS, we will be eliminating non-mission critical positions and bureaucratic hurdles that undermine our mission to secure the homeland. Secretary Noem is determined to return DHS to its core mission of keeping America safe.”\\n\\nCNN has reached out to DHS and DOGE for comment. The Secret Service declined to comment.\\n\\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to send an email to her department’s personnel in the coming days laying out the expected cuts, with a separate email in the works detailing potential options for employees to include voluntary separations and early retirements. One of the sources made clear that Noem’s name may be on that email – but it is top Trump aide Stephen Miller, DOGE and other White House staff making the key decisions.\\n\\nCuts to the Secret Service would come at a particularly challenging time for the agency, which has been strained by what top officials have cast as an unprecedented and dynamic threat environment, including two assassination attempts on President Donald Trump last summer. The agency has been wracked with low morale, burnout, low staffing, and retention issues.\\n\\nThe agency spent an unprecedented $2 million last February on a television recruiting advertisement, tapping blockbuster movie director Michael Bay for the ad.\\n\\nOfficials have repeatedly argued in testimony on Capitol Hill following the assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, that the agency is underfunded and under-resourced.\\n\\nAny cuts at the agency, one of the sources said, are likely to impact administrative and technical staff, but could also impact new hires and those who are within their probationary period, positions that are more easily cut. It is not expected, that source said, to immediately impact the agency’s core missions and readiness – though it could in time, particularly if those in law enforcement roles need to backfill vacant support positions.\\n\\nThere is tremendous anxiety about what could ultimately take place at the USSS among rank-and-file staff, the sources said, and hesitancy to speak to reporters due to the threat of polygraph tests.\\n\\n“It’s hard for the Service to execute on a strategy, which is to bolster their resources and funding – especially in the wake of the attack on President Trump in Butler. How do they build that strategy now having to reduce a workforce?” questioned Jonathan Wackrow, a CNN contributor and former USSS agent.\\n\\nWackrow continued, “The mission is not directly impacted with what is being proposed at this moment – but it will over time. You start creating these intrinsic vulnerabilities in your workforce that could lead to another Butler.”\\n\\nNews of the potential cuts sent shockwaves across DHS component agencies Saturday, multiples sources said, with personnel desperately seeking clarity from their managers regarding whether they might be impacted.\\n\\nAt the Secret Service, senior managers told personnel Saturday that DHS was conducting a downsizing assessment for each of its component agencies, sources said, but any possible cuts remained unclear. Senior Secret Service officials also told the rank-and-file they were awaiting further clarity from DHS leadership, which they hoped to have in the coming days.\\n\\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Italy’s anti-terrorism police unit Digos is leading the investigation and is looking into the possibility that anarchists set fire to the cars on the eastern outskirts of Rome, the source said.\\n\\nDrone images showed the burnt-out remains of cars lined up in a parking lot, with two rows of vehicles back-to-back and a third row some distance away. The fire brigade said in a statement that the blaze broke out at around 4.30am. The dealership was partially damaged, but nobody was injured.\\n\\nOfficials added that they were exploring ‘all avenues’ in their investigation into the cause of the fire. Tesla cars have become targets for vandalism across several countries, in response to the Right-wing activism of company owner Elon Musk.\\n\\nThe tech billionaire, who also owns social media platform X, has joined US President Donald Trump ‘s administration and has come out in support of hard-Right parties in Europe. European sales of Tesla vehicles tumbled 49 percent in the first two months of the year even as overall sales of EVs grew.\\n\\nThis comes after a Tesla dealership in southern France went up in flames during a another suspected arson attack. The showroom in was set ablaze in the early hours of March 3, destroying 12 vehicles worth a staggering £550,000 in what authorities are treating as a deliberate attack. The fire broke out around 3.15am at the dealership in Plaisance-du-Touch, near Toulouse, according to the local prosecutor’s office.\\n\\nOfficials confirmed they have launched an investigation into ‘the destruction and damage of property belonging to others by dangerous means.’ In France, Tesla’s sales plummeted by 45 percent in the first two months of this year compared to the same period last year.\\n\\nThe vehicles were found with broken wing mirrors, smashed windows and bodywork dents outside a electric car showroom in Belfast. Police first received reports about the vandalized Teslas earlier this month. In a statement on March 17, Police Service Northern Ireland (PSNI) said : ‘The damage is believed to have occurred at some point in the last 24 hours.\\n\\n‘Approximately 20 vehicles have been targeted. Most have had their wing mirrors knocked off, while others have also had windows smashed or received dents to the bodywork. ‘Inquiries to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident are ongoing.’\\n\\nOfficers have appealed for any witnesses or anyone with information about the vandalism to come forward. In the United States, Molotov cocktails have been thrown at cars and Tesla charging stations have been destroyed.\\n\\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The Women’s March included A-list stars like Madonna, Miley Cyrus, Jane Fonda, and Cher.\\n\\nTrump hasn’t responded to the protests yet, but defended his tariff economic plan on Truth Social on Saturday. \\n\\nLast year in July, Sweetin challenged the backlash over the opening ceremony at the Paris Olympics which saw a controversial depiction of what appeared to be Leonardo da Vinci’s ‘The Last Supper.’ \\n\\nAt the time, she shared a post to her Instagram stories – which was originally shared by influencer Matt Bernstein – that read: ‘the drag queens at the olympics were re-creating the feast of dionysus, not the last supper. \\n\\n‘and even if you thought it was a christian reference – what’s the harm? why is it a “parody” and not a tribute? can drag queens not be christian too?’ \\n\\nJodie uploaded another video as a comedian explained how it had depicted Dionysus and not The Last Supper. \\n\\nThe actress added her own caption which read, ‘Tell me you don’t know about art or history, without TELLING me you don’t know about art and history…’\\n\\nSweetin’s take on the opening ceremony came shortly after her former Full House co-star Candace Cameron Bure slammed the banquet scene. \\n\\nThe devout Christian – who played D.J. Tanner on Full House – expressed in a video at the time, ‘The Olympic Games have always brought me so much joy. It’s the best of the best athletes in the world competing for the title.\\n\\n‘So to watch such an incredible and wonderful event that’s gonna take place over the next two weeks and see the opening ceremonies completely blaspheme and mock the Christian faith with their interpretation of the Last Supper was disgusting.’\\n\\n‘And it made me so sad. And someone said, “You shouldn’t be sad. You should be mad about it.” And I’m like, “Trust me. It makes me mad.” But I’m more sad, because I’m sad for souls.’\\n\\nAnd in the caption, Candace wrote, ‘You asked me to make this shareable on story, so here it is. My take on the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony. \\n\\n‘Since posting, many have tried to correct me saying it wasn’t about an interpretation of DaVinci’s The Last Supper, but a Greek god and the festival of Dionysus; who is a god of lust, insanity, religious ecstasy, ritual madness etc.’\\n\\nShe added, ‘I still don’t see how that relates to unifying the world through competitive sports and acceptable for children to watch.\\n\\n‘In any case, I’m not buying it. I hope you’ll listen all the way through. God loves each and every one of you and His desire is for you to know Him. I won’t stop praying and calling on Jesus’ name.’\\n\\nAnd in 2023, Jodie had expressed her ‘disappointment’ that her movie Craft Me A Romance was sold to socially conservative TV network Great American Family – which Bure moved to following years with the Hallmark Channel. \\n\\n‘Sometimes, we, as actors, don’t have control over which network buys the projects we are in, nor are we a part of the process in which they get sold,’ Sweetin told People at the time. \\n\\n‘So I was very surprised to learn by reading about it in the press yesterday that the independent film I worked on over a year ago was sold to Great American Family.’', category='entertainment', publish_date='2025-04-06 04:13:12', authors=['Internewscast']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='NBCSaturday Night Live‘s latest cold open mostly mocked President Donald Trump for his recent market-crashing tariffs, but it also took aim at the show’s recent musical guest, Morgan Wallen.\\n\\nJames Austin Johnson reprised his role as Trump and joked about the uninhabited island of McDonald, which the real-life Trump put tariffs on—despite its only residents being penguins. \\n\\n“I want to go to there,” Trump said of the island. “Get me to God’s country, right?”\\n\\nRead more at The Daily Beast.', image='https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/FD3GJRLPZ5HN7HPIBOQTYWQBZY.png?smart=true&auth=f46ef5fb88815ca5106f4c44dd97a1f2807a1d1609cb6bbb713b19a1c9da8c59&width=1440&height=1080', sentiment=-0.235, language='en', video=None, title='‘SNL’s’ Donald Trump Swipes Morgan Wallen’s ‘God’s Country’ Protest', url='https://www.thedailybeast.com/snls-donald-trump-swipes-morgan-wallens-gods-country-protest/', source_country='us', id=308140372, text='Saturday Night Live‘s latest cold open mostly mocked President Donald Trump for his recent market-crashing tariffs, but it also took aim at the show’s recent musical guest, Morgan Wallen.\\n\\nJames Austin Johnson reprised his role as Trump and joked about the uninhabited island of McDonald, which the real-life Trump put tariffs on—despite its only residents being penguins. \\n\\n“I want to go to there,” Trump said of the island. “Get me to God’s country, right?”\\n\\nThe audience applauded.

One wonders whether “only” 61% of Democrats still think this way about Republicans.\\n\\nRep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), for example, appears to represent the preferred approach of many Democrats in “fighting back” and “standing up against” President Donald Trump and “MAGA Republicans.” Yes, President Joe Biden, at an August 2022 fundraiser, said: “What we’re seeing now is the beginning or the death knell of an extreme MAGA philosophy. It’s not just Trump, it’s the entire philosophy that underpins the – I’m going to say something, it’s like semi-fascism.”\\n\\nAnd, when CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked 2024 candidate Vice President Kamala Harris whether she considers Trump “a fascist,” Harris said, “Yes, I do,” later adding, if elected again, Trump would be “a president who admires dictators and is a fascist.”\\n\\nBut Crockett, other elected Democrats and a slew of cable TV hosts, pundits and guests have long abandoned self-restraint by frequently and casually resorting to insults and profanity. Crockett said, “All I want to see happen on my birthday is for Elon (Musk) to be taken down.” About Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), she said, “It’s Ted Cruz. I mean, like this dude has to be knocked over the head, like hard, right? Like there is (sic) no niceties with him, like at all. Like you go clean off on him.”\\n\\nThen there is Crockett’s June 2024 verbal attack on Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), who, like Crockett, is black. On the popular radio show hosted by Charlamagne tha God, she said: “The fact that (you’re) sitting around talking about life was better under Jim Crow, like, is this because you don’t understand history or literally it’s because you married a white woman? And so you think that that whitewashed you?”\\n\\nThe Donalds “Jim Crow” comment pertained to the decline in the percentage of black children born to two married parents. Donalds merely pointed out that during Jim Crow, an era of virulent racism, the nuclear black family was more prevalent than now. Does Crockett consider Harris and Supreme Court Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson examples of “whitewashed” blacks because of the race of their spouses?\\n\\nAnd just days ago, Crockett mocked Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who, after an accident in his 20s, has been paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair. At a March Human Rights Campaign banquet in Los Angeles, Crockett evoked laughter when she said: “You all know we got Gov. Hot Wheels down there. Come on, now. And the only thing hot about him is that he is a hot-a– mess, honey.”\\n\\nCrockett refuses to apologize. As of now, the Democratic Party leadership has said nothing. Neither former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris nor former President Barack Obama issued a statement condemning Crockett’s cruelty.\\n\\nBut during the 2016 presidential campaign when Trump allegedly mocked a disabled reporter, he faced widespread condemnation. But Trump did no such thing. Trump “mocked” what he perceived as reporter Serge Kovaleski’s backpedaling from an article after Trump had referred to it. Kovaleski himself never accused Trump of “mocking him.” Yet NBC News in August 2016 published an article with this headline: “Donald Trump’s Worst Offense? Mocking Disabled Reporter, Poll Finds.” The subheadline read: “Likely voters balked most at Trump mocking a reporter’s disability. What does it say about how Americans think about disability?” The article quoted Tom Harkin, “a prominent voice on disability policy,” who said: “Democrats believe in working together and bringing people with disabilities in to develop policy. Donald Trump? He makes fun of people with disabilities. That’s a throwback to a half a century ago.”\\n\\nFormer President Bill Clinton, addressing the 2016 Democratic National Convention, said Hillary Clinton, Trump’s challenger, “never made fun of people with disabilities. She tried to empower them based on their ability.”\\n\\nCrockett’s smears are just some short-list, rabid, vicious comments from the Trump-hating left as they scramble to find a message that resonates. What is their message on the economy, inflation, the borders and whether biological men should compete in sports against women? Simple: Trump, and his supporters, are “Nazis.”', category='entertainment', publish_date='2025-04-06 02:24:58', authors=['Larry Elder']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Millions of Americans across the country took to the streets to say &#8220;Hands Off&#8221; to the Trump administration, and South Florida was no exception. 7News...', image='https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/250405_Miami_protest_Hands_Off_signs.jpg?quality=60&strip=color', sentiment=0.009, language='en', video='https://house-fastly-signed-us-east-1-prod.brightcovecdn.com/media/v1/pmp4/static/clear/4368278029001/3645d991-8b96-4c01-a486-6a4d4f7b905d/c50d6ec4-2911-47f5-83be-ea89c8134053/main.mp4?fastly_token=NjdmMjNjZTVfZjg1OTEzZWY1ZDMwZDVjYWNiYzVjYzNiMjk5MzdjOWI5N', title='Hundreds protest Trump administration, DOGE’s actions in Miami and Hollywood amid nationwide ‘Hands Off!’ rallies', url='https://wsvn.com/news/us-world/hundreds-protest-trump-administration-doges-actions-in-miami-and-hollywood-amid-nationwide-hands-off-rallies/', source_country='us', id=308126336, text=\"MIAMI (WSVN) - Millions of Americans across the country took to the streets to say “Hands Off” to the Trump administration, and South Florida was no exception.\\n\\n7News cameras captured a large crowd of demonstrators as they marched while holding up signs in downtown Miami, Saturday afternoon.\\n\\n“The people united will never be defeated!” they chanted.\\n\\nAbout 700 people gathered in front of the Torch of Friendship to let their voices be heard.\\n\\nActivists who took part in the rallies, held as part of the “Hands Off!” nationwide movement, said they’re taking a stand against President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who currently heads the Department of Government Efficiency.\\n\\n“This is what democracy looks like,” said a protester.\\n\\n“Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go!” demonstrators chanted.\\n\\nParticipants sounded off on issues like downsizing the federal government.\\n\\n“I’m protesting against the destruction of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

You’ve got to value currency manipulation, you’ve got to value the VAT tax distortions, dumping, export subsidies, technical barriers of trade, agricultural barriers to trade, quotas, bans, counterfeiting, intellectual property theft, and all of that. \\n\\n‘So, here’s the punchline. If you look at the trade deficit… should the U.S. have chronic and sustained deficits? They should not.’ \\n\\nBut Musk remained unconvinced and continued his attacks on Navarro late into the evening, including responding ‘yup’ at 2am to a meme reading: ‘In every disaster throughout American history, there always seems to be a man from Harvard in the middle of it.’ \\n\\nSocial media was left divided by Musk’s break from Trump, with some questioning if it was a sign the billionaire was falling out with the president. \\n\\n‘I’m confused… aren’t you guys on the same team?’ one X user responded. \\n\\n‘Who are you trying to please by publicly dissing Navarro? China? You can’t tell him privately? I thought you are part of the team,’ another added.\\n\\nIt comes as demonstrators gathered at the National Mall in Washington DC to protest against Musk and the cuts he made while at DOGE. \\n\\nThe protests forced First Lady Melania Trump to postpone the White House spring garden tours, because they would clash with the demonstrations. \\n\\nTrump said as he announced his tariffs this week that nations around the world will be hit with at least a 10 percent tariff on their imports with some reaching up to a whopping 50 percent.\\n\\nThe tariffs are being levied based on ‘barriers to entry.’ That means the European Union will be hit with 20 percent tariffs because it charges a 39 percent tariff on America. \\n\\nThe U.K., on the other hand, got off relatively easy. Since it only charges the U.S. a 10 percent tariff, it will pay 10 percent in return.\\n\\nChina will pay a 34 percent tariff, with the White House calculating that the U.S. pays 67 percent when currency manipulation is factored in.\\n\\n‘My fellow Americans, this is liberation day, we’ve been waiting for a long time,’ Trump proclaimed. ‘In a few moments, I will sign a historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world.’\\n\\nAs Trump spoke the stock market tanked – with Dow futures dropping more than 250 points, the S&P 500 falling 100 points and Nasdaq futures dripping more than 400 points.', category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-06 02:12:57', authors=['Internewscast']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Protesters waved signs and chanted at six demonstrations held across San Diego County on Saturday', image='https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sut-l-handsoff-protest-019.jpg?w=1024&h=682', sentiment=0.117, language='en', video=None, title='Nearly 12,000 ‘Hands Off!’ protesters jam downtown San Diego, marching against Trump and Musk', url='https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/04/05/nearly-12000-hands-off-protesters-jam-downtown-san-diego-marching-against-trump-and-musk/', source_country='US', id=308123692, text='Thousands of opponents of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk clogged the streets of downtown San Diego on Saturday, marching, chanting and waving signs protesting the administration’s actions on a host of issues that included government downsizing efforts, immigration policy and LGBTQ+ issues.\\n\\n“This is the only tool we have to stand up, to be seen, to be heard,” said one of the participants, Jay Duchnick, a 60-year-old registered nurse from North Park.\\n\\nThe San Diego Police Department estimated the size of the crowd at 12,000 people.\\n\\nThe march, which started around noon at Civic Center Plaza just outside City Hall, seemed to gain in numbers as the demonstration went on.\\n\\nBy the time the front of the demonstration reached its final destination at the Hall of Justice on the corner of Broadway and State Street, marchers could be seen taking up approximately 15 square blocks.\\n\\nLynn Favor of North Park, a retired computer software manager, said she was encouraged by the size of the crowd that featured marchers chanting slogans such as “This is what democracy looks like,” and waving hand-made signs blasting Trump and Musk.\\n\\n“I think marching lets other people know, who also think what’s going on doesn’t feel right, that there’s a lot of people with you,” Favor said. “And I appreciate the opportunity to scream my feelings out.”\\n\\nNo counter-demonstrations were observed and no incidents of violence or vandalism were reported, according to San Diego police.\\n\\nThe rally was part of a national “Hands Off!” movement that saw demonstrations at more than 1,200 locations in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C. The national protests were led by a coalition of groups, largely coordinated by Indivisible, described on its website as a grassroots organization “with a mission to elect progressive leaders, rebuild our democracy, and defeat the Trump agenda.”\\n\\nRichard Cannon of Indivisible North County San Diego said the downtown rally’s message to demonstrators was, “Your voice matters. Your elected representatives are not going to save you. You have to show up and save yourself.”\\n\\nAcross San Diego County, similar protests were held in Encinitas, Rancho Bernardo, Carlsbad, Oceanside and Borrego Springs.\\n\\nA few hundred people lined the blocks of Rancho Bernardo Drive, cheering and drawing a chorus of honks from drivers passing by. It was an inter-generational protest, drawing youths and older adults alike. Several demonstrators waved American flags.\\n\\nThe Oceanside Police Department reported no problems at the Oceanside demonstration. About 400 people attended the rally in Encinitas, with no disruptions noted, according to the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office.\\n\\nThe downtown rally attracted a host of elected Democrats on the national, state and local levels.\\n\\n“This is not what people voted for,” said Rep. Scott Peters. “They did not vote for higher prices. They did not vote for the disruption of the peace and prosperity we’ve built with this country over eight decades, not voted to defund science and not voted to bend the truth.”\\n\\nRep. Sara Jacobs said she was “excited to see how many San Diegans have turned out to make their voices heard and to make sure that we are fighting back against this administration that’s trying to gut programs that so many rely on, like Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.”\\n\\nWhen asked about Trump vowing his administration will not cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits, Jacobs said, “I hope that’s true, but the president says a lot of things and then the congressional Republicans go ahead and do it anyways.”\\n\\nSan Diego City Councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera spoke out against Trump’s immigration and deportation actions, saying the administration is violating due process.\\n\\n“If someone violates the law, they violate the law, but what we’ve seen in the last few weeks, there’s no way of knowing whether or not folks have violated the law,” Elo-Rivera said. “We have folks who are legally permitted to be in the United States being ripped out of their communities and away from their families. If that’s not wrong, I don’t know what is.”\\n\\nProtesters also directed their ire at Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, who has taken an active role in the Trump administration as head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.\\n\\nMusk and his team at DOGE have a stated goal of cutting federal government bloat, but critics say the advisory board’s actions have been sloppy and led to firings and cancellations of valuable government contracts, prompting a rash of lawsuits.\\n\\nLucia, 71, of San Diego, who did not want to disclose her last name, held a sign that read, “Nobody likes you, F-Elon!

It was the realization of his four decades of advocacy for a protectionist foreign policy and the belief that free trade was forcing the United States into decline as its economy shifted from manufacturing to services.\\n\\nThe tariff announcement was the latest and perhaps boldest manifestation of Trump’s second-term freedom to lead with his instincts after feeling his first turn in the Oval Office was restrained by aides who did not share his worldview. How it shakes out could be a defining judgment on his presidency.\\n\\nThe early reviews have been worrisome.\\n\\nFinancial markets had their worst week since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign trade partners retaliated, and economists warned that the import taxes may boost inflation and potentially send the U.S. into a recession. It’s now Republican lawmakers who are fretting about their party’s future while Democrats feel newly buoyant over what they see as Trump’s overreach.\\n\\nDemocratic activists participated in rallies across the country Saturday in the largest demonstrations since Trump returned to office in January. “The winds are changing,” said Rahna Epting, who leads MoveOn, one of many organizing groups.\\n\\nTrump is unbowed.\\n\\nHe has promised that the taxes on imports will bring about a domestic manufacturing renaissance and help fund an extension of his 2017 tax cuts. He insisted Thursday as the Dow Jones fell by 1,600 points that things were “going very well” and the economy would “boom,” then spent Friday at the golf course as the index plunged 2,200 more points.\\n\\nThe White House stayed the course Saturday. “This past November, America resoundingly rejected the business-as-usual policies coming out of D.C.,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai, adding, “The entire Trump administration is aligned on delivering on President Trump’s mandate to reject the status quo.”\\n\\nIn his first term, Trump’s tariff threats brought world leaders to his door to cut deals. This time, his actions so far have led to steep retaliation from China and promises from European allies to push back.\\n\\nEven some Trump supporters are having their doubts.\\n\\nFrank Amoroso, a 78-year-old resident of Dewitt, Michigan, said he is concerned about short-term rising interest rates and inflation, although he believes the tariffs will be good for the country in the long run.\\n\\nAmoroso, a retired automotive engineer who voted for Trump, said he would give the president’s second-term performance a C-plus or B-minus. “I think he’s doing things too fast,” he said. “But hopefully things will get done in a prudent way, and the economy will survive a little downfall.”\\n\\nRep. French Hill, R-Ark., in a telephone town hall with constituents Thursday night, expressed reservations about the broad nature of the tariffs.\\n\\nHill, who represents a district that includes Little Rock, said he does not back tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He said the administration should instead focus on renegotiating a U.S. trade agreement with its two neighbors.\\n\\n“I don’t support across-the-board tariffs as a general matter, and so I don’t support those, and I will be urging changes there because I don’t think they will end up raising a bunch of revenue that’s been asserted,” Hill said. “I wish I thought they did, but personally I don’t think they will. But I do support trade diplomacy.”\\n\\nStill, much of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” coalition remains publicly supportive.\\n\\nDoug Deason, a prominent Texas-based Republican donor, said he loves the president’s tariff plan, even if it causes some economic disruption.\\n\\n“He told us during the election there would be pain for every American to get this ship turned around,” Deason said. “It is hard to watch our portfolios deteriorate so much, but we get it. We hope he holds course.”\\n\\nAs Trump struggles with the economy, Democrats are beginning to emerge from the cloud of doom that has consumed their party ever since their election drubbing in November.\\n\\nThey scored a decisive victory in Wisconsin’s high-profile state Supreme Court election on Tuesday, even after Elon Musk and his affiliated groups poured more than $20 million into the contest. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker then breathed new life into the Democratic resistance by delivering a record 25-hour-long speech on the Senate floor that centered on a call for his party to find its resolve.\\n\\nBooker told The Associated Press afterward that a significant political shift has begun even as his party tries to learn from its mistakes in the 2024 presidential election.\\n\\n“I think you’re seeing a lot more energy, a lot more determination, a lot more feeling like we’ve got to fight,” Booker said. “You can’t sit back any more. You can’t sit on the sidelines. There’s a larger, growing movement.”\\n\\nBooker, a 2020 presidential candidate, acknowledged he is not ruling out a 2028 run, although he said he is focused on his 2026 Senate reelection for now.\\n\\nThere is broad agreement among Democrats — and even some Republicans, privately at least — that what Trump has unleashed on the global economy could help accelerate the Democratic comeback.\\n\\nEzra Levin, co-founder of the progressive resistance group known as Indivisible, has been critical of Democratic officials’ response in recent weeks to Trump’s leadership. But on Friday, he was somewhat giddy about the political consequences for Trump’s GOP after the tariffs announcement.\\n\\n“Raising prices across the board for your constituents is not popular,” Levin said. “It’s the kind of thing that can lead to a 1932-style total generational wipe out of a party.”\\n\\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

They also forbid non-citizens from voting in elections. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the Social Security Administration notes on its site that non-citizens can receive benefits.\\n\\n‘Lawfully present noncitizens of the United States who meet all eligibility requirements can qualify for Social Security benefits,’ the SSA website states. ‘This rule also applies to noncitizens authorized to work in the United States who got a Social Security number after December 2003.’ \\n\\nStill, clips of the explanation, and other portions of the Wisconsin event, quickly went viral on Musk’s social media app X as users cheered the fraud-finding effort. \\n\\n‘It is absolutely infuriating,’ one user wrote in response to the findings. ‘Nothing to see here. Just 5x SSNs during the 2024 election year. Using our tax dollars.’\\n\\n‘Thank God for DOGE,’ X CEO Linda Yaccarino commented on the findings. \\n\\n‘Biden and team were bringing in millions of immigrants and putting them on benefits,’ another user wrote reacting to the SSA numbers. ‘I know Elon keeps saying it was for votes but that can’t be the only reason.’\\n\\nMusk also skewered former President Joe Biden for enabling the jump in social security numbers. \\n\\n‘People sometimes think that under the Biden administration that he was simply asleep with the switch,’ Musk said. ‘They weren’t asleep at the switch.’\\n\\n‘It was a massive, large scale program to import as many illegals as possible, ultimately, to change the entire voting map of the United States and disenfranchise the American people and make it a permanent, deep, blue, one party state from which there would be no escape,’ the 53-year-old entrepreneur shared.\\n\\nAnother user reacted on X: ‘Mind blowing fraud and corruption.’\\n\\nThough some pushed back on the DOGE claims. \\n\\n‘So we’re just believing every unvetted claim these guys make,’ another wrote. \\n\\nThe Sunday event was meant to galvanize Wisconsin voters to turn out the vote for a Republican candidate for the state’s Supreme Court election on Tuesday. \\n\\nThe world’s richest man has taken a special interest in the contest since it will certainly impact the state’s congressional maps, and therefore the slim GOP majority in the House of Representatives.\\n\\nThe billionaire Tesla CEO even handed out million dollar checks to event attendees who signed Musk’s latest political petition.', category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-06 01:19:30', authors=['Internewscast']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Demonstrations took place across the country, uniting a myriad of criticisms of the Trump administration under one message: \"Hands off.\"', image='https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4892x2752+0+405/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2Fc6%2F515796df4da7b0a0e9fd51f06820%2Fgettyimages-2208686203.jpg', sentiment=0.189, language='en', video=None, title=\"Nationwide 'Hands Off' protests erupt against Trump and Musk\", url='https://www.npr.org/2025/04/05/nx-s1-5353388/hands-off-protests-washington-dc', source_country='us', id=308124676, text='Demonstrators gathered across the country on Saturday, many animated by differing issues, but united in opposition to the Trump administration with the single message: \"Hands off.\" \\n\\nOrganizers said more than 1,300 \"Hands Off\" rallies of varying sizes took place on Saturday.\\n\\nSince President Trump took office in January, various protests have taken place against his administration\\'s plans and policies — from the mass firing of federal workers to immigration raids to the involvement of billionaire Elon Musk in the federal government.\\n\\nSaturday\\'s protests appeared to be the most widespread to date of Trump\\'s second term.\\n\\n\"There are so many issues,\" said Kelley Laird from Rockville, Md., who attended a rally in Washington, D.C., on Saturday. \"They\\'re coming after education, coming after health care, coming after the arts, coming after the press.\"\\n\\nIn Boston, protesters gathered to push back against the federal cuts on research and against the arrest of Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University doctoral student who was arrested by federal agents in plain clothes, as member station WBUR reported. \\n\\nIn Sylva, N.C., over 300 people came together to oppose cuts to national parks, education and veteran services, according to BPR News.

While the White House has insisted that the Trump administration will not make cuts to Social Security benefits, there are plans for major changes, including the closure of dozens of Social Security offices; the elimination of thousands of jobs; and a new policy that will require more stringent identity checks.\\n\\n\"I was going to rely on this money. Is it going to be there?\" said Lundy, who said she served in the Army.\\n\\nAl and Bev Mirmelstein were among the passengers in a three bus caravan that traveled to the D.C. rally from Charlottesville, Va., organized by the group Indivisible Charlottesville. At the protest, the Mirmelsteins held up signs that read: \"Hands off our Constitution, rule of law, Social Security, free speech, health care,\" and \"Save our democracy.\" \\n\\nThe couple said they joined multiple protests back home too, including one against the opening of a Tesla showroom.

Garlin Gilchrist II and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel spoke.\\n\\nThe groups included activists for reproductive rights, immigrant rights, government workers and foreign policy issues like the Gaza War and support for Ukraine.\\n\\nThousands rally in Detroit despite rain\\n\\nLight rain didn’t dampen the enthusiasm in Detroit, where protesters boarded the QLINE and made their way to the Detroit Institute of Arts amid a relentless blast of car horns from traffic on Woodward.\\n\\nFor Kathy Cassar, 65, it was a family affair. She, her sister and her brother-in-law walked up to the DIA to find hundreds of people, signs in tow, covering the front steps.\\n\\n“Congress do your job,” one sign read. \\n\\nAnother: “Hands off free speech.” \\n\\nCassar drove more than an hour from Hartland to Detroit to express her outrage over the Trump administration, which she described as “reprehensible.” \\n\\n“I have never been so afraid for my country in my entire lifetime,\" she said. \"What is happening now is terrifying.\" \\n\\nThe firing of federal workers and changes to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would affect everyone, she said. \\n\\nMore: Live updates: Anti-Trump protesters set to gather at hundreds of locations nationwide\\n\\n“We need federal workers. These are Americans. These are our neighbors,” Cassar, who identifies as an independent but voted for Kamala Harris last November, said.\\n\\nWynonia McGee, a Black woman who lived through the Jim Crow era, said she feels as though the country is slipping back to that time. She showed up Saturday to do her part to make sure the country doesn\\'t go backward.\\n\\n“I am determined to make sure I do my part, to make sure that doesn’t happen. I have grandchildren, great grandchildren to fight for,” the 75-year-old retired business owner and casino worker said. “My parents and ancestors, they fought for me, and we\\'re not going back. It’s very personal to me. That’s why I’m out here, and I continue to be out here. We’ve got to get rid of this administration, from the top to the bottom.”\\n\\nThere\\'s so much division in the country, across race, religion and ethnicity, said McGee, who lives in Canton, but grew up in Detroit.\\n\\nAs she walked with her cane, carrying her sign alongside other demonstrators, she protested to send a message, not to Trump, but to the lawmakers backing him who \"don\\'t have a spine,\" she said. \\n\\n\"We mean business,\" she said. \"We\\'re not sitting still.\"\\n\\nMary-Kate Deneau protested, in part, for her daughter\\'s future.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want her to grow up in a world where she has less rights than me,\" the 35-year-old said as her 3½-year-old daughter, Carson, sat in her wagon with her snacks and sign in hand.\\n\\nDeneau worries about her children\\'s education and the environment they may grow up in. \\n\\n\"I think about the curriculum, the things that maybe aren\\'t allowed to be taught and then I think about, as they get older, are they going to be able to visit the national parks, are they going to be told who they can love, or their friends are less than because they look a certain way, or they can\\'t live a certain lifestyle? I worry that she won\\'t have choices if something would ever happen to her, that it\\'s up to the government to decide,\" she said. \\n\\nDespite the rain, joining Saturday\\'s protest with her parents and child was a \"no-brainer,\" she said. \\n\\n\"This is our history, this is her future,\" Deneau said.\\n\\nWayne State University students Cameron Smith and Keegan Kopp learned about the protest that same morning and felt compelled to join to make their voices heard and stand up for others.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to live my life in a closet. I had enough years of that,\" Smith, a 19-year-old freshman who is gay, said. \\n\\nHis partner, Kopp, who is also a freshman, said he feels as though the country is a lot more politically divided than ever before and the current administration is moving the nation backward instead of forward. The pair worried about threats to gay marriage but felt as though there\\'s still a fight to be fought. \\n\\nAnd so joining the demonstration was an opportunity to speak out. It was a moment of gratitude, reflection and joy. \\n\\n\"I\\'m just so happy to see that this is beyond people on their phones and on TikTok, like we\\'re actually here,\" Smith said. \\n\\nFerndale protesters \\'fed up\\' with Trump, Musk\\n\\nOver at a protest in Ferndale, Ron Smith and Maureen Moons said they have so many issues with Trump and his policies it’s hard to pick just one to rally around. \\n\\n“We’re all getting flooded,” Smith, 75, of Rochester, said. “We got it up to our waist. It started at our ankles, and it\\'s up to our waist.”\\n\\nSmith said as an Air Force veteran, he took an oath to support and defend the Constitution.\\n\\n“It’s beyond my comprehension how anyone who is a veteran could support Trump,” he said.\\n\\nFerndale resident Emily Mandziara said she opposes Trump’s actions and the hate she feels the administration is spreading.\\n\\n“We the people are fed up with every single one of his policies,” Mandziara said. “Someone that claims to be a man of faith, a Christian, goes directly against everything that Jesus taught. I\\'m a Catholic myself. Anybody that is truly of faith would be against them (Trump and his administration).”\\n\\nKile Telas, of Ferndale, is a union steward for United Commercial and Food Workers Local 876. He said he is concerned about workers benefits, Medicare and Medicaid. \\n\\n“I’m here protesting against oligarchs going to Washington that are trying to take over the government and basically circumvent democracy in Washington,” Telas said. “And to fight against fascism that seems to be creeping up in the U.S. government and the fight for democracy and freedom. Nobody elected Elon Musk.” \\n\\nThousands protest at state Capitol\\n\\nIn Lansing, participants filled the state Capitol lawn, waving handmade signs opposing Trump and Musk and urging Congress to act. \\n\\nKim Winchell, 70, of Freeland, and Denise Lennon, of Bay City, traveled to the protest together after meeting each other online through the group Women of Michigan Action Network.\\n\\n\"We\\'re feisty grandmas,\" Winchell said. \"We care about our grandchildren\\'s future. This is not how government is supposed to work. Trump is just ruining the government, the country. It\\'s ridiculous.\"\\n\\nToo many people are suffering because of Trump\\'s actions and democracy is at stake, Lennon said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a 250-year-old democracy that could be over,\" she said. \"We\\'ve never had a president who has said not only did he not need votes but that people wouldn\\'t have to vote again.\"\\n\\nParker Perez, 16, came with his grandmother Sherri Bible, of Oakland County.

I just never knew how.”\\n\\nAlong with spending cuts, the president has signed more than 100 executive orders since returning to office Jan. 20, including directives to curtail birthright citizenship, assert executive control over regulatory agencies, dismantle other federal agencies and overhaul the election process.\\n\\nTrump’s administration has defended the cuts and executive actions as necessary to conserve taxpayer money and fulfill election promises, while opponents have accused the president of an ongoing, undemocratic power grab benefitting himself and his associates.\\n\\nThe idea that Trump and Musk pose a threat to American democracy was reflected in the signs held by protesters, many of which ridiculed the two and compared them to fascist political figures, and in the statements made by speakers.\\n\\nColorado Attorney General Phil Weiser described the state’s efforts to fight Trump’s executive orders in court and said the size of Saturday’s crowd was proof that opponents of the administration “will not be intimidated.”\\n\\n“Just like fear is contagious, so is hope,” Weiser said. “What we need to recognize is (that) the rule of law, the Constitution, they are in the balance.”\\n\\nJessie Danielson, a Democratic state senator representing Lakewood and the west side of the Denver area, also denounced Trump’s public lambasting of judges who have blocked some of his policies.\\n\\n“They are threatening judges to give them cover for corrupt and illegal actions that defy our laws and our Constitution,” Danielson said. “Using fear and extortion, Trump and Musk attack, every day, the very ideas of free press, free speech and freedom of thought.”\\n\\nProtesters marched through downtown Denver after the conclusion of the speeches. During the speeches, some protesters, flanked by members of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, also began marching west on Colfax Avenue, blocking traffic and chanting in opposition to Trump and U.S. military aid to Israel.\\n\\nGraham Ottley, joined by his wife and two young children, said his family took part in the protest and march in part because of the federal government’s policies on immigration, which have impacted the nonprofits he and his wife work with. He said they also wanted to show their children what it means to be active participants in a democracy.\\n\\n“We want them … just to be active and engaged with what’s going on in our political system, and to feel like they have a voice, and that they matter as citizens in our country,” he said. “We’re excited to just exercise our rights.”\\n\\nLabor unions and activist groups also set up booths around the Capitol steps during the event, which was scheduled to last until 4 p.m.\\n\\nSaturday’s protest was organized by the Colorado 50501 Chapter, Move On, Colorado Indivisible, Solidarity Warriors, Political Revolution and Common Ground People’s Collective, and it coincided with similar “Hands Off!” protests that the chapter said in a news release were taking place in all 50 states and in Europe.\\n\\nProtests were also scheduled in Boulder, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, Greeley, Pueblo and other Colorado cities, according to the Colorado 50501 Chapter.\\n\\nStay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot.', category=None, publish_date='2025-04-06 00:23:44', authors=['Max Levy']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Minnesota “Hands Off!” demonstrators said they’re concerned about Trump’s deportations, trade war against allies, and billionaire presidential adviser Elon Musk’s push to downsize the federal government.', image='https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-jea-PROTEST-0405-10.jpg?w=1024&h=541', sentiment=-0.106, language='en', video=None, title='Anti-Trump ‘Hands Off!’ rally draws thousands at Minnesota Capitol', url='https://www.twincities.com/2025/04/05/anti-trump-hands-off-rally-draws-thousands-at-minnesota-capitol/', source_country='us', id=308116896, text='Thousands rallied at the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul and across the state Saturday as part of national protests against President Donald Trump’s policies, which organizers say are an “assault” on freedoms and leading to a “billionaire takeover” of government.\\n\\nMinnesota “Hands Off!” demonstrators said they’re concerned about Trump’s deportations, trade war against allies, and billionaire presidential adviser Elon Musk’s push to downsize the federal government, which has already resulted in tens of thousands of layoffs and billions in reported cuts to everything from foreign aid to scientific research.\\n\\nA common theme among those in attendance was a fear of an emerging authoritarianism in the U.S. with what they see as fewer barriers to Trump in his second term as president. “Wake up Americans, this is fascism!” read one sign. Many others carried signs reading “No Kings.”\\n\\nRecent arrests of foreign university students with ties to Gaza war protests were a big area of concern for Seldon Caswell of White Bear Lake, who said immigration authorities are violating the constitutional right to due process.\\n\\n“Masked people wearing no uniform, who refuse to identify themselves, snatching people off the street? That should alarm everybody,” said Caswell, 53. “I am horrified that people I don’t know, students who were registered had a legal visa to be here — suddenly, their visa is gone, and they’re suddenly an illegal immigrant in our country to be disappeared.”\\n\\nCaswell and many others were first-time protesters. They represented a wide set of groups opposed to Trump’s agenda on a range of issues and carried signs telling the president and Musk to keep their “hands off” funding for education, health and science, or LGBTQ+ rights.\\n\\nOthers were troubled by Trump’s treatment of close U.S. allies, like Canada, whom the president has recently hit with tariffs in an effort to pressure the country to do more to combat what Trump has called unfair limitations on U.S. goods.\\n\\n“We have a Canadian flag flying in front of our house,” said Ann Walters, 63, of St. Paul. “Those are the best neighbors ever. We just can’t believe that we’re starting a trade war with all these people.”\\n\\nWalters and others were among what Minnesota Capitol Security said was a crowd of up to 25,000 people — though estimates varied. Officers blocked several nearby streets in order to safely fit the rally, which caused heavy midday traffic in the blocks immediately surrounding the state Capitol.\\n\\nActivists and state lawmakers, including Rep. María Isa Pérez-Vega, DFL-St. Paul, and Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, as well as Minnesota 4th District Congresswoman Betty McCollum, spoke to the crowd, which gathered from around noon to about 2:30 p.m. in front of the Capitol.\\n\\n“We’re fighting back against Musk and Trump and their illegal and unconstitutional actions,” McCollum said in a brief speech.\\n\\nThe event was just one of more than 1,200 events in all 50 states planned by groups ranging from unions, veterans and LGBTQ+ advocates, the Associated Press reported.\\n\\nThe White House issued a statement in response to questions from the AP about the protests, downplaying concerns about federal cuts.\\n\\n“President Trump’s position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries,” the statement said. “Meanwhile, the Democrats’ stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors.”\\n\\nBesides the rally at the state Capitol, protesters gathered in other Minnesota cities, including Duluth and Rochester. The St. Paul rally was backed by the 50501 movement, which led a large anti-Trump protest at the state Capitol in February, as well as Indivisible Twin Cities and Women’s March Minnesota.\\n\\nThe Republican Party of Minnesota said the rally was organized by “radical progressive groups” and showed that the Democratic Party is “rudderless” and “out of ideas.”\\n\\n“If this is the best the radical Left has to offer — old ideas, more government waste, and endless complaining — then we welcome the contrast,” Minnesota GOP Chairman Alex Plechash said in a statement.\\n\\nWhile there have been anti-Trump showings in Minnesota since he took office again in January, Saturday’s rally was by far the largest, and organizers vowed to continue to pressure the administration and other elected officials with protests.\\n\\n“It’s time to get off the couch, get out and say something, do something,” said Don Pelton, a 71-year-old veteran from Cottage Grove who decided to join the Indivisible group just one week ago. “I don’t think that the legislators, the government, as it stands right now, can’t ignore it.”\\n\\nVanessa Plata, 46, of Maple Grove, said she’s always been politically engaged, but that Saturday’s rally was the first time she had attended a protest in person. Plata, who immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico, said she believes institutions meant to place checks and balances against Trump are failing.\\n\\n“We can’t continue just sit idle and pretend that what would have been what has been done to the country is normal,” she said. “People are waking up … realizing this is not OK, just a power grab, it needs to stop.”', category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-05 23:51:59', authors=['Alex Derosier']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='When Liz Gabbitas joined thousands of fellow protesters Saturday in the US capital, she thought her message to the Trump administration would be best delivered through her homemade sign: a cardboard guillotine.', image='https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4591894/demonstrators-dressed-characters-handmaids-tale-gather-national-mall-nationwide-hands.jpg', sentiment=-0.348, language='en', video=None, title=\"'Hands Off!'

Chanting, waving flags, and holding handmade signs, the crowd stretched nearly 20 blocks.Organizers said more than 600,000 people had signed up to participate in protests across the country. In New York City, the rally began at Bryant Park around noon, with demonstrators marching down Fifth Avenue through Madison Square Park.Protesters carried signs opposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare, demanding protections for immigrants and civil rights, and condemning federal downsizing efforts led by Musk\\'s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Some demonstrators waved American flags and held cardboard signs with clever slogans. One read, \"Billionaires are attacking fed workers for protecting you.\" Another declared, \"This is what democracy looks like.\"Early in the protest, many participants hesitated to speak on the record out of fear of retaliation. But as the afternoon continued, people began to open up.\"This is what we\\'re standing out here in the cold for,\" Frank Hickey, a former police officer who lives in Manhattan, said. \"This is what we\\'re getting fallen arches and stiff backs for—and I think it\\'s important.\"Hickey, who previously volunteered in Ukraine teaching self-defense and leading a book club, called the protest \"an extension of the lawlessness of the Trump regime.\"Some protesters focused on single issues—such as defending Medicare or Social Security—while others voiced broader opposition to the Trump administration and the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement. Musk was also a frequent target. Several signs demanded his \"deportation,\" while others denounced the influence he\\'s had on the Trump administration since the campaign.Musk, who was born in South Africa, moved to the U.S. in 1992 to attend college. He initially entered the country on an Exchange Visitor Visa before transitioning to a work visa and eventually gaining citizenship.Kailani, a 26-year-old graduate student from the Bronx, said she feared the collapse of constitutional safeguards. \"The most concerning thing is the blatant disregard of the court orders that have been issued,\" she said. \"The checks and balances are not working and are being actively destroyed.\"Though largely peaceful, the protest saw a brief confrontation in Madison Square Park between an anti-Trump marcher and a Trump supporter. Police quickly stepped in. The pro-Trump counterdemonstration remained small.One of the Trump supporters involved in the altercation, Brian, said he attended the protest to push back against what he described as cultural confusion and societal decline.\"You\\'ve got people with cat litter boxes in schools. It\\'s a bunch of brain syndrome,\" he said. \"Life isn\\'t about grown men\\'s feelings. If nobody ever gave a s*** about my part of life, why should I care about yours?\"He added: \"No politician is good, but there are politicians that are worse than the other ones. At some point you got to take a stand.\"The New York protest wound down by 6 p.m., with some groups staying behind to chant and speak out against what they described as \"the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies,\" as one protester told Newsweek.Earlier this week, Trump announced global sweeping tariffs that have rattled global and domestic markets, with Wall Street tanking over the past few days, marking the worst days for the U.S. stock markets since 2020.What People Are SayingThe Hands Off! mission statement articulates specific grievances: \"They\\'re dismantling Social Security and Medicare—forcing seniors and disabled Americans to jump through hoops to access the benefits they\\'ve already paid into. They\\'re handing trillions to billionaires—while forcing the rest of us to pay higher prices for food, rent, and healthcare.\"President Donald Trump told Fox News in February: \"Social Security won\\'t be touched, other than if there\\'s fraud or something... It\\'s going to be strengthened... Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"Former Vice President Kamala Harris wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday: \"Today, in every state across our nation, Americans are standing up to the administration as they implement Project 2025 at full speed.\"Trump has distanced himself from Project 2025 and previously called parts of the 900-page guideline spearheaded by The Heritage Foundation \"ridiculous and abysmal.\" However, he has brought on some individuals associated with it into his administration.What Happens Next?Organizers hope the nationwide protests will sway lawmakers on issues such as voting rights, social services, and economic policy.', category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-05 23:25:42', authors=['Jesus Mesa']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Tens of thousands of protesters mustered in cities and towns across the country on Saturday to sound off against the Trump administration.', image='https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/fc87ef7a-c147-4de3-80ef-8cdf6f2ef3e1/washington-protest-gty-jt-250405_1743877379035_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600', sentiment=-0.002, language='en', video=None, title=\"Huge crowds gather in 'Hands Off' rallies nationwide in protest of Trump admin\", url='https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/huge-crowds-gather-hands-off-rallies-nationwide-protest/story?id=120523176', source_country='US', id=308157418, text='Tens of thousands of protesters mustered in cities and towns across the country on Saturday to sound off against the Trump administration\\'s cuts to the federal government and its polices.\\n\\nCarrying homemade posters and chanting \"Hands Off,\" the protesters came out to the more than 1,200 rallies nationwide despite rain in many cities, according to organizers.\\n\\nSeveral Democratic heavyweights, including some members of Congress, joined the protests and urged the public not to stand for what they called the administration\\'s mismanagement and breaking with constitutional norms.\\n\\n\"Our founders wrote a Constitution that did not begin with \\'We the dictators,\\'\" Rep.

The rallies appeared peaceful, with no immediate reports of arrests.\\n\\nFrom the National Mall and Midtown Manhattan to Boston Common and multiple state capitols, thousands of protesters assailed Trump and billionaire Elon Musk ‘s actions on government downsizing, the economy, immigration and human rights. In Seattle, in the shadow of the city’s iconic Space Needle, protesters held signs with slogans like “Fight the oligarchy.”\\n\\nMusk, a Trump adviser who owns Tesla, SpaceX and the social media platform X, has played a key role in the downsizing as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency. He says he is saving taxpayers billions of dollars.\\n\\nKelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign advocacy group, criticized the administration’s treatment of the LBGTQ+ community at the rally at the National Mall, where Democratic members of Congress also took the stage.\\n\\n“The attacks that we’re seeing, they’re not just political. They are personal, y’all,” Robinson said. “They’re trying to ban our books, they’re slashing HIV prevention funding, they’re criminalizing our doctors, our teachers, our families and our lives.”\\n\\n“We don’t want this America, y’all,” Robinson added. “We want the America we deserve, where dignity, safety and freedom belong not to some of us, but to all of us.”\\n\\nIn Boston, demonstrators brandished signs such as “Hands off our democracy” and “Hands off our Social Security.”\\n\\nMayor Michelle Wu said she does not want her children and others’ to live in a world in which threats and intimidation are government tactics and values like diversity and equality are under attack.\\n\\n“I refuse to accept that they could grow up in a world where immigrants like their grandma and grandpa are automatically presumed to be criminals,” Wu said.\\n\\nRoger Broom, 66, a retiree from Delaware County, Ohio, was one of hundreds who rallied at the Statehouse in Columbus. He said he used to be a Reagan Republican but has been turned off by Trump.\\n\\n“He’s tearing this country apart,” Broom said. “It’s just an administration of grievances.”\\n\\nHundreds of people also demonstrated in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, a few miles from Trump’s golf course in Jupiter, where he spent the morning at the club’s Senior Club Championship. People lined both sides of PGA Drive, encouraging cars to honk and chanting slogans against Trump.\\n\\n“They need to keep their hands off of our Social Security,” said Archer Moran of Port St. Lucie, Florida.\\n\\n“The list of what they need to keep their hands off of is too long,” Moran said. “And it’s amazing how soon these protests are happening since he’s taken office.”\\n\\nThe president planned to go golfing again Sunday, according to the White House.\\n\\nAsked about the protests, the White House said in a statement that “President Trump’s position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries.

Regarding the remarks, originally made on \"The View,\" Burr said, \"I don’t watch the news.\" He added, \"I have no idea what’s going on. I watch Instagram. I watch people wipe out on motorcycles.

You need to get your balls back and it’s not my job.

And they’re going to move onto the next Earth and, you know, everybody’s going to be standing down here in their blue and red ties going, ‘Wait a minute, I was on your side.’ And they’re just going to leave.\" Burr also shot down questions about Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in one of the most highly publicized murder cases in the country. BILL BURR TELLS \\'THE VIEW\\' ELON MUSK GOING TO \\'TRASH\\' THE PLANET \"Tell us about your reaction to Luigi Mangione,\" another reporter asked Burr. \"I was reading up, you know, that perhaps you’ve been supportive of what he did.

I mean, I’m here for Conan. I’m not doing all of this. What are you going to bring up next, the Middle East? I went to summer school three out of four years in high school. I’m not qualified to talk about this.\" Regarding Mangione, Burr spoke to Variety magazine in January and expressed some amusement at the suspected murderer putting pressure on healthcare CEOs. \"The funny thing when that CEO got whacked was watching CEOs have to be uncomfortable,\" Burr said. \"I’m sure they didn’t learn anything, but it’s like: This is how you make everybody feel day to day as you apply pressure because ‘that’s how business is done.’ How you leave this burning wreckage of destroyed lives as you ‘restructure’ and ‘consolidate.’ It was fun to see them worry.\" Fox News\\' Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report.

Trump recently told Cabinet members that Musk’s time at the White House would soon end, but did not provide specifics, Politico reported.\\n\\nTHE ROOTS OF PROTEST\\n\\nProtests like these take place when residents feel that typical, institutional channels — things like writing letters to the editor or contacting one’s representative — feel “blocked or dysfunctional,” said Laura Henry, professor of government at Bowdoin College. Individually, people may feel compelled to protest by a desire to find solidarity with others and sparking tangible change, she said.\\n\\n“There often does have to be some level of organizational support, however modest, to kind of get the ball rolling, to say here’s when and here’s where,” Henry said. “People are much more likely to protest if they belong to networks. … (If) they feel like they’re going to go there and see people from their community who they know.”\\n\\nRecent protests have included broad demonstrations against Trump and his administration’s slash-and-burn approach to reducing the federal workforce. A poster for Saturday’s rallies across the state highlighted impacts to health care, education, national parks and Social Security in an apparent attempt to draw individuals concerned about a wide range of issues.\\n\\nAndy Wright, of Falmouth, held a sign at the Portland protest that read, “Hands off Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare.”\\n\\n“I’m 65; I was planning on Social Security checks — not so sure anymore,” Andy Wright said.\\n\\nMUSK, TRUMP AND MORE\\n\\nSuccess in political action may hinge on activists’ ability to combine multiple issues and points of view under a larger umbrella without falling into factions, researchers who study political action and change said.\\n\\n“(Protestors) come together because they have to have a voice, because other than that, there is depression,” said Pat Fogg, one of the organizers of the protest in Auburn and Lewiston on Saturday. “And the scrutiny in the administration is chaotic. They have removed anyone who is competent and have replaced everyone with incompetency.”\\n\\nStrong protest movements are often built on coalitions of several demographics guided by a shared understanding of the issues, said Henry, the Bowdoin professor. But when multiple groups come together, who may not agree on every issue, it can be difficult to maintain a sense of unity.\\n\\n“Once people feel that collective framing, they’re more likely to feel empowered, like their participation really could help send that message,” Henry said. “It is always a challenge to keep these movements together. They are prone to fragmentation.”\\n\\nDee, the South Portland protest organizer, said she is encouraging people to keep the momentum going after Saturday by calling their members of Congress and continuing to demonstrate.\\n\\n“My sign says ‘hands off public education,’ because my career was in public education, but I saw a lot of other signs at the poster party — hands off the environment, hands off veterans, off Social Security, everything,” Dee said. “But this is a huge fault on the foundations of America.”\\n\\nProtestors expressed similar sentiments at the Auburn rally. Susan Murphy, of Bridgton, said the changes in the federal government make her fear for the future of generations to come.\\n\\n“It’s going to take well over a generation to rectify,” Murphy said. “And I can’t let that go by and just be sitting at home and be complacent about it.”\\n\\nTRANSGENDER ATHLETES\\n\\nMaine has been catapulted into the center of the debate about transgender people’s right to participate in girls’ and women’s sports — resulting in protests on both sides.\\n\\nFollowing Gov. Janet Mill’s public defiance of a Trump executive order banning transgender athletes from high school competition, some Mainers rallied behind the governor, while others called for her immediate removal.\\n\\nStudents and parents from Maine School Administrative District 51, which serves students in Cumberland and North Yarmouth, organized a protest last month to support transgender students.\\n\\nOrganizers at the rally said political action can be community-led.\\n\\n“It’s a beautiful opportunity to recognize that one person does make a difference, and we have an opportunity right now in this community to really show the state, and show the country, that it just takes some concerned citizens and a gathering of people to really get our voices out there,” said organizer and MSAD 51 parent Leah McDonald.\\n\\nProtestors and counter-protestors clashed last month at a “March against Mills” at the State House in Augusta. Organizers called for Mills to be removed as governor and demanded that girls’ and women’s sports be restricted to those assigned female at birth.\\n\\nThe Cumberland-North Yarmouth district entered the national conversation after a transgender Greely High School student won an indoor track championship this winter. Subsequent federal investigations found Maine, the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in violation of federal Title IX law, pressuring the state to change its stance on transgender athletes or lose federal funding.\\n\\nProtestors taking part in Saturday’s “Hands Off!” rallies also expressed support for transgender people, with some in Portland waving transgender flags and holding “support trans kids” signs.\\n\\nProtesting at the State House on Saturday, 80-year-old Susanne Ashland, of Farmingdale, said she had hoped that transgender people, Black people, immigrants and women would have equal rights by this point in her life.\\n\\n“I guess (I was) wrong,” said Ashland, who had her 80th birthday on Saturday. “Because for some reason, people think that’s not important.”\\n\\nGAUGING SUCCESS, MOMENTUM\\n\\nThe recent protests are the latest in a lengthy history of political action in Maine, said state historian Earle Shettleworth. He noted significant demonstrations like those at Colby College during the Vietnam War, which were heightened by the killing of four students at Kent State University in Ohio, and major strikes among Maine’s textile workers during the Great Depression.\\n\\n“Those are just two (examples), but there’s a long history,” Shettleworth said.\\n\\nSteven Barkan, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Maine, also noted the impact of the Kent State shootings on Mainers, saying there is often an inciting incident that compels individuals to voice what may once have been private opinions. He pointed, as a more recent example, to the 2020 killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, which triggered national outrage following years of action by Black Lives Matter.\\n\\n“Triggering events have occurred, as when the Tufts University graduate student was grabbed and disappeared last month by masked law enforcement agents, which since has triggered ongoing Boston-area protests,” Barkan said in an email on April 1. “So it does seem at this early stage that a discontent threshold has been reached, where people have become so outraged that they are finally beginning to feel compelled to protest.”\\n\\nHenry, the Bowdoin political scientist, said protests can have multiple goals — from showing support, to growing a base, to actually changing policy — making it difficult to determine their efficacy. She argued that the most effective protests tend to be those with clear and specific asks.\\n\\n“It’s not a really simple relationship between protest and political change,” Henry said. “It may be that our elected officials react to a protest, but that’s never the last word. This is a process, rather than an event.”', category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-05 22:34:34', authors=['Katie Langley']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Massachusetts may be a reliably blue state, but my hometown of Marshfield is not.

It was one of the thousands of such protests happening in big cities and small towns across the country. The energy of the opposition to Trump was apparent as I drove downtown, into the heart of the protest, past the town hall and a strip mall with pizza and burger joints.

A retired federal worker, she worked for more than 20 years with Head Start programs, which support low-income children. Project 2025 recommends eliminating and alleges the program is “fraught with scandal and abuse” and offers “little or no long-term academic value for children”—despite ample research that shows otherwise. The future of Head Start is even more uncertain after Tuesday’s mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which houses the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), the office that administers the program. As a result of cutting Head Start, Drogue said, “there’s going to be a lot of kids and families going hungry; there’s going to be a lot of people that don’t make it through high school and can’t earn a living.”\\n\\n“The Head Start programs in the New England region now have no one to go to help them get the money that was promised to them. There’s no one there—they just fired everybody,” she added. The Boston Head Start office is one of five that will be closed following Tuesday’s layoffs, according to the National Head Start Association.\\n\\nMore from Patty & Sue on why they came out today:[image or embed]— Julianne McShane (@juliannemcshane.bsky.social) April 5, 2025 at 3:41 PM\\n\\nIndeed, the impact of the chaos Trump and Musk are unleashing across the federal government was what drove several protesters out into the rain, they told me.\\n\\nDrogue’s friend, Sue Fitzgerald, said her daughter will soon graduate college with a biomedical engineering degree. She’s concerned about RFK Jr.’s dismantling of HHS, which has also included cuts to some of the offices that work on reproductive health and disability issues, as my colleagues and I have reported. “We need to save healthcare, but also scientific research,” said Fitzgerald, who lives in the bordering (and slightly redder) town of Pembroke.\\n\\nPeter Brown, who said he is a retired OB-GYN and lives in Norwell, is most worried about the attacks on the health system, including RFK’s boosting of anti-vaccination viewpoints; slashing of National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for critical research; undermining of efforts to support maternal health; and gutting of the FDA, among others. “I’m horrified that our country used to lead the world in research, and now it’s decimated,” Brown said.\\n\\nPeter Brown, a retired OBGYN from the nearby town of Norwell, on why he came out:[image or embed]— Julianne McShane (@juliannemcshane.bsky.social) April 5, 2025 at 4:41 PM\\n\\nProtesters said they are also disturbed by Trump and Musk’s dismantling of USAID, the agency that provided foreign humanitarian aid and would have helped the recovery effort following the recent devastating earthquake in Myanmar, as I recently reported. “I’m a humanitarian,” Fitzgerald said. “That’s more important to me than money.” Gutting USAID, in her view, was “terrible.” \\n\\n“Government is not a business—it is here to work for and with the people,” added Christine, a protester from Marshfield who declined to provide her last name. “We’ve taken away any good that America has done.” She works in the medical field and, like many American consumers, expects Trump’s tariffs will affect her wallet.\\n\\n“The cost of my supplies will definitely go up because gloves and masks are made in China,” Christine said. “I tried to prepare for it, but I don’t think I even ordered enough in advance.”\\n\\nAnother economic concern for protesters: cuts to their safety nets. “I don’t want them to take away the Social Security that we already paid—that’s stealing,” said Jim Carson, who said he retired after nearly 50 years working in the newspaper business. Trump, Carson added, “promised he wouldn’t touch it—but he’s going to let Musk cut it, so he can say, ‘it wasn’t me.\\'” \\n\\nMusk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, spearheaded the firing of about 7,000 workers at the Social Security Administration, and plans to fire potentially thousands more in the coming weeks, the Washington Post reports.

Terri described herself as a “lifelong independent” who has historically leaned conservative, but Trump and Musk’s antics led her to register as a Democrat on Friday, she said. “It’s disturbing how much we are not taking care of our people and how much we’re going to lose if we don’t stop this.”\\n\\nChristine, the protester who worked in the medical field, and Terri’s friend, said she wishes Republican members of Congress voted against Trump’s unqualified cabinet members. But she’s finding hope in how some Democrat members are openly resisting: “Look at what Cory Booker just did; look at what Bernie Sanders and AOC are doing,” she said.\\n\\n“Where are the Republicans? Where’s the outrage?” asked Erin Herman, a resident of the nearby town of Cohasset, who works in sales. “Right now we just have to hold him to basic standards—that’s really what we’re asking for. Follow the Constitution, follow the law, and quit trouncing on our rights.”\\n\\nThe crowd cheered at honking cars even as the rain got heavier and the air got colder; by about 2:30 p.m. EST, they dispersed. Deborah Cornwall, one of the protest’s organizers, saw the success of the event as a sign of a shift. “Marshfield has been very red,” she told me, “but attendees today may be changing that in coming elections.”\\n\\nThe protesters I spoke to were pushed out into the dreary afternoon because, like Carson, the retired newspaper worker worried about cuts to Social Security, they felt they had no choice. “I was happy until Trump and Musk came along,” he said, “and now, we gotta stand up and fight.”', category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-05 22:34:02', authors=['Julianne McShane', 'Tim Murphy']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Hauser frets that amid federal cutbacks, young scientists may turn away from medical research, knee-capping health care progress for decades to come.', image='https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SJM-L-SCIAWARD-0000-01.jpg?w=1024&h=683', sentiment=0.159, language='en', video=None, title='Bay Area scientist wins major award for multiple sclerosis research', url='https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/04/05/bay-area-scientist-wins-award-worries-trump-cuts-health/', source_country='us', id=308102580, text='A Bay Area researcher on Saturday received science’s equivalent of a Hollywood Oscar for a surprising, transformative discovery about multiple sclerosis that offers hope of freeing those with the chronic illness from its debilitating effects.\\n\\nUC San Francisco neurology professor Dr. Stephen Hauser, who shared with a Harvard professor a $3 million Breakthrough Prize for his research into MS and development of a pioneering treatment, “overturned the scientific consensus on the mechanism of MS,” and was instrumental in revolutionizing doctors’ approach to the common disease, a spokesperson for the award said.\\n\\nHauser’s discovery about MS, a neurological disease affecting nearly a million Americans, came on a ferry trip in British Columbia after he worked for decades to untangle the causes of MS and find possible treatments.\\n\\n“When I first started — 47 years ago now — this quest to understand and successfully treat MS, the outlook for patients whose MS was beginning was severe disability within 15 years, or worse,” Hauser said. “For patients who are beginning their MS journey now, I think they can be optimistic that a life free from disability is achievable.”\\n\\nOn that 1997 ferry ride from Vancouver to Vancouver Island, a remark from a colleague led Hauser to laboratory investigations that upended scientists’ belief that T-type white blood cells wrought most of the neurological damage from MS. On the ship headed toward a meeting in B.C.’s capital Victoria, Claude Genain, a postdoctoral researcher in Hauser’s lab, suggested that perhaps B-type white cells were the main culprit. Hauser’s confirmation led to a pioneering treatment using a drug to kill B cells.\\n\\nThe drug therapy blocks nearly all of the bursts of inflammation that cause attacks of MS, so after a few years of treatment, if started early enough, “patients have on average less than one attack of MS per lifetime,” Hauser said. “Relapsing MS is really in the rearview mirror.”\\n\\nHowever, researchers have found that a slow neurological degeneration occurs in the disease, partially independent of inflammation. The antibody-based drug slows that process about 40% in early MS cases, and about 30% in later stages, Hauser said. “We’re hopeful that if we can treat very, very early it may stop it entirely,” he said.\\n\\nHauser, director of UCSF’s Weill Institute for Neurosciences, received his Breakthrough Prize just as the U.S. National Institutes for Health — a primary funder of his work for decades — faces billions of dollars in cuts and the firing of more than 1,000 leaders and staff as Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency works to dramatically slash government spending and programs. A federal court lawsuit filed this week in Massachusetts by the American Public Health Association and others accused the federal government of a “reckless and illegal purge” that has seen hundreds of NIH-funded research projects “abruptly cancelled.” Musk in a February social media post called the amount universities spend to administer NIH grants “a ripoff.”\\n\\nAt the Weill Institute, which has received $1 billion in NIH funding since opening in 2016, Hauser and his team are probing connections between viruses and migraine, Lou Gehrig’s disease and Parkinson’s, to come up with new treatments. They are also studying novel ways to combat depression, autism, Alzheimer’s disease, psychosis, addiction and stroke, as well as improving the treatments for MS.\\n\\n“This is going to be the golden age for medicine in the next generation and sooner if we’re able to keep on course,” Hauser said. “It’s an ecosystem that’s fragile and if any piece of it weakens then the gears can come apart.”\\n\\nHauser frets that amid the Trump administration targeting of the NIH, young scientists may turn away from medical research, knee-capping health care progress for decades to come.\\n\\n“I’m feeling worried about young people who are just beginning careers in medical science and are getting phone calls every week enticing them to do other things at far higher salaries,” Hauser said. “That could have generational consequences.”\\n\\nSharing the life-sciences Breakthrough Prize with Hauser was Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio, who discovered that infection with the widespread Epstein-Barr virus was necessary for getting MS. Ascherio’s work “opens the possibility of treating MS with antiviral drugs” and development of a vaccine against Epstein-Barr that could prevent MS, said the Breakthrough Prize spokesperson.

We do not provoke trouble, but we are not afraid of trouble. Pressure and threats are not the right way to deal with China. China has and will continue to take firm measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests,” the statement said.\\n\\nIt said China would continue to promote “high-level opening-up” rather than closing its economy with even higher tariffs.\\n\\n“Economic globalization is the inevitable path for the development of human society,” it said.“ “The world needs justice, not tyranny!”\\n\\nJaguar and Land Rover pause shipments to US\\n\\nThe British maker of Jaguar and Land Rover cars is pausing shipments to the U.S. as it works to mitigate the impact of a 25% tax on vehicle imports imposed by the Trump administration.\\n\\nJaguar Land Rover Automotive, one of Britain’s biggest carmakers, said Saturday that the pause would take place this month.\\n\\n“The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands,” the company said in a statement. “As we work to address the new trading terms with out business partners, we are taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid-to-longer term plans.”\\n\\nThe U.K. automotive industry is expected to be hard hit by the new tariffs, which come at a time when British carmakers are struggling with declining demand at home and the need to retool their plants for the transition to electric vehicles.\\n\\nTrump says China has been hit harder by tariffs\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday morning posted on his Truth Social media site that China has been negatively impacted by tariffs “much harder than the USA, not even close.”\\n\\nNewly announced U.S. tariffs on nations around the world, including 34% tariffs on China, have sent stock markets reeling for days. China has vowed to match the rate that Trump imposed.\\n\\nOn Saturday Trump was at his golf course in Jupiter, Florida. It’s his first time visiting the club since his second term started. Spotted in his motorcade, in his signature red MAGA hat and white polo shirt, Trump was reading a tabloid article about China’s response to U.S. tariffs.\\n\\n“They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,” Trump said on Truth Social. “We have been the dumb and helpless “whipping post,” but not any longer.”\\n\\nItaly’s economy minister cautions against retaliatory tariffs\\n\\nItalian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti warned that imposing retaliatory tariffs on the United States would be damaging for both Italy and Europe.\\n\\nSpeaking at a business forum in Cernobbio, near Milan, Giorgetti said Saturday that Italy is working for a “de-escalation” with the U.S. following Trump’s announcement of a general tariff of 20% on European Union countries.\\n\\n“We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,” Giorgetti said. “Our message is that we need to avoid pushing the panic button. … We are following a pragmatic and rational approach.”\\n\\nGiorgetti proposed the EU allow member states to raise spending by relaxing the bloc’s fiscal rules. \\n\\nItaly has a very limited budget leeway, as the government forecast its giant debt rising through 2026 to almost 138% of GDP. \\n\\n“The Italian public debt means reduced budget room for our country, a constraint that must be taken into account in any decisions we make,” Giorgetti said, also referring to EU plans to increase defense spending.\\n\\nTaiwan will provide support for industries hit by tariffs \\n\\nTaiwan’s says it will provide a $2.65 billion fund to aid industries most affected by U.S. tariffs. \\n\\nTaiwan has a trade surplus with the U.S., but much of it comes from Taiwanese industries trying to fulfill the U.S. demand for Taiwan’s information technology products. Officials say Taiwan plans to negotiate with the U.S. on how the new tariff rate of 32% was determined and try to get a better deal.\\n\\nPremier Cho Jung-tai has been charged with working closely with industries that are impacted and to communicate the public about their plans to stabilize the economy.

Trump said in a February Fox News interview that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits, will not be \"touched\" unless \"there\\'s fraud or something.\"The protests are taking place just days after Trump\\'s global sweeping tariffs which have rattled global and domestic markets, with Wall Street tanking over the past few days, marking the worst days for the U.S. stock markets since 2020.The Villages, located in Central Florida, is a Republican stronghold, making it notable that demonstrations are taking place there against the GOP president, who has deep ties to Florida through real estate investments and political allies.The Villages is primarily represented by Republican Representative Daniel Webster of Florida\\'s 11th Congressional District. Newsweek has reached out to Webster\\'s press team for comment via email on Saturday.What To Know The Villages is a predominantly white retirement community for residents aged 55 and older that spans three Central Florida counties, Lake, Sumter, and Marion. All three counties voted comfortably for Trump in 2024: Marion at 65 percent, Lake at 62 percent, and Sumter at 68 percent.A spokesperson for \"Hands Off!\" estimated that approximately 2,000 people in The Villages participated in the nationwide protests on Saturday. Democratic congressional candidate Barbie Harden Hall, who is running to represent Florida\\'s 11th congressional district, which includes The Villages posted video of protests, writing that \"more than 1,500 came out today,\" with clips showing dozens of residents in golf carts lined up with signs protesting the president and Musk.More than 1,200 \"Hands Off!\" demonstrations across all 50 states were planned for Saturday, with a handful taking place in Europe as well. Local protests are being organized by advocacy groups, civil rights groups, labor unions, and various election and democracy activists, among others. Large crowds of protesters filled the streets in major cities across the country, including Boston, New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C., with many demonstrating despite the rain.The organization calls upon local advocacy groups and organizers to mobilize people to speak up against the administration, writing: \"Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. They\\'re taking everything they can get their hands on and daring the world to stop them. On Saturday, April 5th, we\\'re taking to the streets nationwide to fight back with a clear message: Hands off!\"The website notes that a \"core principle\" of the protests is \"nonviolent action,\" and urges protesters to \"act lawfully\" at the events.During the 2024 presidential campaign, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, campaigned in The Villages, where videos showed dozens of golf carts displaying support for her campaign.A handful of Trump-supporting cities held \"Hands Off!\" protests on Saturday, including Rome, Georgia, where 70 percent of county voters backed Trump\\'s 2024 presidential bid, Midland, Michigan, where 56 percent supported him at the polls last November, and Little Rock, Arkansas, located in a county where 70 percent voted for Trump.Protests also took place across Florida, where Trump is a resident and frequently visits his golf course and Mar-a-Lago estate.What People Are Saying A \"Hands Off!\" spokesperson told Newsweek in a phone interview on April 5: \"The goal is hands off. You don\\'t see this kind of turn out from folks unless people are frustrated, upset about what their government is doing...Hands off all the things that they [the government] is trying to take away in order to give billionaires tax cuts.\"Roxey Nelson, 1199SEIU Florida Executive Vice President, told Newsweek in a Saturday email: \"When hundreds of thousands turn out in top GOP stronghold areas across the country, it\\'s not just a rally—it\\'s a reckoning.

Over half a million people signed up to attend \"Hands Off!\" rallies nationwide through a coalition of groups such as Indivisible and MoveOn, but the turnout in Pittsfield well exceeded the pre-registered roster.\\n\\nResidents also gathered in Adams, Williamstown, Great Barrington and West Stockbridge and Stockbridge Saturday as part of the protests. The grassroots organization Greylock Together chartered a bus to head to a larger rally in Boston, bringing 55 people to the state capitol and inviting others to follow by carpool.\\n\\nIn Pittsfield, protesters endured frigid drizzles, but were buttressed by a near-constant cacophony of car horns from all directions. The park was filled with folk songs, call-and-response chants and speakers airing their grievances against the administration.\\n\\nJohn Bonifaz, president and co-founder of Free Speech For the People, were among the speakers. He urged attendees to support bringing articles of impeachment against Trump.\\n\\nPointing to Article II, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, Bonifaz said the Founding Fathers wrote it as a safeguard to presidents like Trump.\\n\\n“They put that provision into the Constitution to address the very moment we have today: a lawless president who commits multiple abuses of power and must face impeachment and removal — that is why we have the impeachment clause!” Bonifaz said during his speech. “No kings in America!”\\n\\nMany signs took aim at the “Department of Government Efficiency,” an effort spearheaded by Trump adviser and tech billionaire Elon Musk to shrink the size of the federal government, while others pushed back against recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and economic unrest from the recent tariffs.\\n\\n“I didn’t vote for Trump, and nobody voted for Elon, and the destruction they’re doing to our institutions and the pillars of American democracy, thought and our role in the world are just being blown up — chopped, willy-nilly,” said protester Karin Stack.\\n\\nFor Wessel, Medicare and Medicaid was top of mind — her spouse is disabled, and relies heavily on those programs to get the care she needs.\\n\\n“We’re lucky enough that I earn enough at the moment that we’ll be okay without the Social Security, but her health care costs would crush us instantly if she loses her Medicare coverage for all her different conditions,” Wessel said.\\n\\nThe erosion of the “social safety net” was critical to Shannon Stephens, who worries for her mother, a recipient of Medicare and Social Security benefits.\\n\\n“My mom is on oxygen, so she needs these social safety nets literally just to survive,” Stephens said. “Surviving is the bare minimum, and I feel like the current administration is trying to take away the bare minimum.”\\n\\nStephens thinks, too, of her 5-year-old son and the example she wants to set for him in trying times.\\n\\n“I don’t want my son to wonder why things got this bad and we didn’t do anything to stop it,” Stephens said.\\n\\n\\'Everything\\'s at stake\\'\\n\\nOn the streets outside Great Barrington Town Hall, a crowd of hundreds rallied Saturday morning in South County.\\n\\n“I’m here because I feel like everything that makes America great is about to be destroyed,” said Rachel Bart, adding that she’s worried about the recent cuts to federal health spending.\\n\\nProtesters voiced concerns about potential cuts to higher education funding, immigration policy changes, elimination of diversity programs and what several described as a troubling move toward authoritarianism.\\n\\nClaude Fethiere and Natasha Tarpley said that they feel like their heritage is “under attack” amid recent government actions, such as the rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives under the Trump administration.\\n\\n“I\\'m worried about the culture of our country becoming one of violence and going back to white supremacy in a way that has never left us, but that becomes our day-to-day life, and that is very threatening to us as African Americans,” said Tarpley.\\n\\n“Also the elimination of our history,” Fethiere added, referencing recent efforts from the Trump administration to diminish Black history in public schools and beyond. “Black people have been here from the very beginning.

Many said they were most worried about the economy and their retirement investments, which have dwindled in tandem with Trump\\'s tariff announcements. The crowds also skewed older compared to protests during Trump\\'s first term.Here\\'s what they told us and what surprised us the most.As I rode the train from Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan, the subway car filled with protesters, their cardboard signs bumping up against umbrellas on a rainy Saturday in New York.By 1 p.m., the 42nd Street station was even more crowded than usual. Older people clutched slippery canes, and young kids clutched their parents\\' hands. One man wore a once trendy Harris Walz camo hat. Another waved a small American flag, an unusual display of patriotism at anti-Trump rallies.The damp horde of protesters shuffled toward Bryant Park, and in some ways, it all felt familiar. There were chants about abortion, signs featuring the face of now-deceased Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a progressive icon, and a steady cacophony of car horns.But some things were different this time.For one, the crowd looked older, with middle-aged Americans seeming to outnumber the 20-somethings that dominated rallies during the pandemic. It makes sense since many Americans are watching their retirement savings dwindle in the face of crashing markets and worry that staff cuts to the Social Security Administration could impact the crucial safety net.While the anti-government protests held during Trump\\'s first term focused on social issues — like abortion and civil rights issues — many of the signs today targeted the economy.Most of the people I spoke to didn\\'t want to share their last names because they worried about their privacy in the current political environment. Yet they weren\\'t shy about their rage and despair.Dorothy Auer, 62, told me she wished people would get angrier.\"I\\'ve been working for over 40 years, and I looked at my investments yesterday — my retirement plan — and I literally don\\'t think I\\'ll ever be able to retire,\" she said, starting to choke up.Wiping her eyes with her free hand — the other held a black and white sign bashing Musk — Auer told me it\\'s distressing to see a man of such wealth \"turn around and crap on us.\"Jian, 33, held a sign that read, \"Tariffs are killing my 401(k),\" but he told me he\\'s most upset about what\\'s happening to his retired father.\"My dad just lost about 25% of his savings in the last three days because of the tariffs,\" he said.It\\'s not just the economy, of course, that brought thousands of people out to Midtown Manhattan.Penny, 54, said the Trump administration affected virtually every issue she cares about. Even so, we ended up talking about Musk.\"I\\'m horrified that a person who wasn\\'t born here, wasn\\'t elected, seems to be getting carte blanche to do whatever he wants in our government,\" she said. \"How did he get a security clearance?\"Most of those I talked to as they slowly trudged toward Madison Square Park didn\\'t think the protest would change Trump\\'s mind.A few said they hoped Congress would pay attention, but more than that, people said they felt they needed to do something.\"Even if it\\'s sort of hopeless right now, at least it\\'s showing people that we\\'re here,\" Pyare, 49, told me. \"And that we don\\'t like it.\"Another week, another protest.On Saturday, I attended the Hands Off! rally in Novi, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit where 55% of the vote went to Kamala Harris during the election. Thousands of people showed up.The crowd was emotionally charged and united by the spirit of collective action. Many attendees said they were first-time protesters. The Tesla Takedown protests I attended last weekend seemed somber by comparison. Protesters here got loud.\"Call me Old Lady Army Fighting for Democracy,\" one 66-year-old woman, who didn\\'t want to give her real name, told me. She held up a sign she had made. It was a charcoal drawing of the Statue of Liberty, whose hands covered her eyes in shame.\"I just copied this off of Facebook,\" she said. But to her it symbolized that \"everything that our country stands for is being destroyed, and the world is looking at us.\"Liana Gettel, 58, said she was outraged for several reasons, including the administration\\'s stance on abortion. She said she had an abortion 29 years ago.\"I had lost a child. The child would not come out on its own. So I had to have a procedure. Had I not had that procedure, I wouldn\\'t be here,\" she said. \"And that\\'s what they want to block, is things like that?\"Protesters targeted many different issues, including abortion, trans, and minority rights. One protester holding up a sign for trans rights said, \"Trans people are just the appetizer, but everyone will be on the menu now.\"The line echoed remarks made by human rights advocate Channyn Lynne Parker at the Rally for Trans Visibility in Chicago last weekend.Unlike protests during Trump\\'s first term, which focused on social issues, however, many people today were also worried about the president\\'s economic policies.Matt Watts said he was protesting Musk\\'s takeover of Social Security and Trump\\'s tariffs on \"countries that don\\'t deserve it.\" After the stock market began to take a hit from all the talk of tariffs, Watts said he took his money out of his 401(k) and invested it into a more stable fund. \"I\\'m getting ready to retire pretty soon. I\\'ve got to count on that savings,\" he said.The majority of protesters were middle-aged or older, but they managed to capture some younger activists with their energy.Yajat Verma, 18, said he hadn\\'t known about the protest but was driving by with a friend when he saw the crowd. He decided to join in and started handing out water bottles to protesters.\"Everyone should be protesting,\" he said.', category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-05 21:50:13', authors=['Alice Tecotzky', 'Lakshmi Varanasi']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Thousands of protesters crowded onto Boston Common on Saturday for a &#8216;Hands Off&#8217; rally against recent cuts to federal organizations made by President Trump&#8217;s administration...', image='https://whdh.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/hands-off-1.jpg?quality=60&strip=color', sentiment=-0.185, language='en', video=None, title='Thousands march through Boston during ‘Hands Off’ protest', url='https://whdh.com/news/thousands-march-through-boston-during-hands-off-protest/', source_country='us', id=308095100, text='BOSTON (WHDH) - Thousands of protesters crowded onto Boston Common on Saturday for a ‘Hands Off’ rally against recent cuts to federal organizations made by President Trump’s administration and Elon Musk and tariffs on foreign countries.\\n\\nThe huge crowd, which eventually made its way to City Hall Plaza, had a clear message to Trump and Musk, “Hands off Boston.” \\n\\n “We’re trying to protect democracy,” said Karl Jacobsan. “I don’t want Trump taking away our rights, it’s heading toward democracy right now and my wife and I don’t appreciate that.” \\n\\nThe local demonstration was part of a nationwide response to recent funding cuts to federal programs and reciprocal tariffs that rattled the global economy.\\n\\n“There is so much going on our world is not the same anymore, we’re just fighting for our rights, we just want life to be good for all citizens of the United States,” said Peggy Johnson.\\n\\nPeople of all ages came out to make their voices heard.

More than 50 demonstrations were scheduled across Michigan, including in Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor, Kalamazoo, Muskegon, Saginaw and Detroit.\\n\\nRELATED: Protests against Trump-Musk ‘power grab’ planned at over 50 Michigan locations\\n\\nProtesters accused Trump and Musk of dismantling the country’s government through a “brazen power grab” that included shuttering Social Security offices, firing essential workers, deporting immigrants, cutting federal funding and programs, and more. \\n\\nGrand Rapids protest organizer Becky Palmer said she felt Trump and Musk misled voters to believe they would help everyday Americans, when in reality their tariffs and cuts to social programs would only line the pockets of the wealthiest. \\n\\n“When was the last time you felt like billionaires were really working for you?” Palmer said. “That’s not how they got there.”\\n\\nOver 4,000 people marched through downtown Grand Rapids Saturday afternoon, with attendees spanning from college-aged students to families with young children to retirees. \\n\\nThe environment was lively and energetic -- cheers of “this is what democracy looks like” and “Donald Trump has got to go” echoed through the streets as protesters lined the sidewalks holding anti-Trump signs and passing cars honked. \\n\\nSome of the biggest issues that drew protesters in Grand Rapids included Trump’s immigration crackdown and government cuts, as well as concerns over LGBTQ+ and women’s rights.\\n\\nSparta siblings Mia Longworth, 21 and August Longworth, 18, said they felt there have been increased attacks against the LGBTQ+ community under Trump.\\n\\n“(Hatred is) way more prevalent and more accepted by everybody,” August Longworth told MLive. “Just because he’s in office, they think they can be 10 times more hateful than before.”\\n\\nTrump’s partnership with Musk was also a key concern for many protesters. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, heads the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, where he has led mass efforts to downsize the government through federal layoffs and funding cuts.\\n\\nRELATED: Flint feels sting of DOGE cuts after EPA revokes $1M environmental justice grant\\n\\nGrand Rapids residents Sharon Breuker, 74, and Judy Hardy, 70, said they feel like the government is no longer working for the people. \\n\\n“It seems like their goal is to privatize everyone -- cut all of it and then let private people take it over,” Breuker said. “It’s all about rich people.”\\n\\nSpeakers at the Grand Rapids rally also spoke about Trump’s nationwide immigration crackdown, which has been a point of concern for many activists in West Michigan, where there is a large immigrant population.\\n\\nNerida Aviles, a Mexican immigrant who has lived and worked in Grand Rapids for over two decades, said the Trump administration has painted immigrants out to be freeloading criminals.

DOGE was created by President Donald Trump and is run by Elon Musk.\\n\\nWhere are the MSHA offices being considered for closure?\\n\\nAccording to the DOGE website, 34 MSHA offices in 19 states have been targeted for closure. This includes seven in Kentucky, which would leave the fifth-leading coal producing state with just two MSHA facilities.\\n\\nThere also are four offices slated to close in Pennsylvania; two apiece in California, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Texas and West Virginia; and one each in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming.\\n\\nAre other mining offices involved?\\n\\nAlso under consideration for closure are the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement facilities in Lexington, Kentucky, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, shrinking the national footprint of an agency created during the Carter administration to restore land damaged by strip mining and reclaim abandoned and damaged minelands.\\n\\nPotential savings\\n\\nEnding the MSHA leases is projected to save $18 million. It’s unclear whether inspectors’ positions and other jobs from those offices would be moved to other facilities.\\n\\nMSHA responsibilities\\n\\nMSHA was created by Congress within the Labor Department in 1978, in part because state inspectors were seen as too close to the industry to force coal companies to take the sometimes costly steps necessary to protect miners. MSHA is required to inspect each underground mine quarterly and each surface mine twice a year.\\n\\nAgency inspectors are supposed to check every working section of a mine. They examine electrical and ventilation systems that protect miners from deadly black lung disease, inspect impoundment dams and new roof bolts, and make sure mining equipment is safe, said Jack Spadaro, a longtime mine safety investigator and environmental specialist who worked for MSHA.\\n\\nMining fatalities over the past four decades have dropped significantly, in large part because of the dramatic decline in coal production. But the proposed DOGE cuts would require MSHA inspectors to travel farther to get to a mine, and Spadaro said that could lead to less thorough inspections.\\n\\nA review last month of publicly available data by the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center indicates that nearly 17,000 health and safety inspections were conducted from the beginning of 2024 through February 2025 by staff at MSHA offices in the facilities on the chopping block. MSHA, which also oversees metal and nonmetal mines, already is understaffed. Over the past decade, it has seen a 27% reduction in total staff, including 30% of enforcement staff in general and 50% of enforcement staff for coal mines, the law center said.\\n\\nCoal facts and figures\\n\\nThe coal industry has been in decline as utilities have installed more renewable energy and converted coal-fired plants to be fueled by cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas.\\n\\nU.S. coal production was at 1 billion tons in 2014 and fell to 578 million tons by 2023, the latest year available, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It has been in a long, steep decline for decades.\\n\\nCoal industry deaths were in the hundreds throughout the 1950s and 1960s. After MSHA was created, deaths steadily decreased, then dropped even further in the last decade as a growing number of mining companies shut down and thousands of jobs were eliminated. There have been 11 or fewer deaths in each of the past five years, according to MSHA.\\n\\nCoal employment rebounded from 2022 to 2023, rising 4.2% to 45,476. West Virginia employed the most miners at 14,000, followed by Kentucky at 5,000. About half of the nation’s 560 coal mines are located in West Virginia (165) and Kentucky (112).

Since then, he has stood by his decision to hike U.S. tariffs to their highest levels in more than a century, even as the move sparked a global market meltdown.\\n\\nSome manufacturing advocates and economists questioned Trump’s underlying logic, saying supply chain issues, high costs, workforce needs and the laborious process of moving production to the U.S. stand in the way. Continued uncertainty about Trump’s long-term policy could also have a chilling effect, they said.\\n\\nIf the tariffs aren’t enough to convince companies to move operations to the U.S., it could mean Americans bear the heavy burden of the economic havoc Trump’s announcement unleashed without the promise of future benefits. That could heighten political risks for Trump and his fellow Republicans.\\n\\n“While we certainly agree we should aggressively pursue any policy that helps us make things in America, the idea that you can move every part of the manufacturing process back to the U.S. does not align with reality,” said Kip Eideberg, senior vice president for the Association of Equipment Manufacturers.\\n\\nEideberg, whose group represents makers of equipment used in construction, agriculture, mining, utilities and forestry, added that with businesses relying on components and labor from around the world, “you can’t just pick all that up and just move it over the U.S.”\\n\\nEconomists say companies are not going to commit to the time and investment required to reshore production to the U.S. if they don’t think the tariffs are permanent, and Trump has vacillated between saying his policies will never change and he’s open to negotiations.\\n\\nEconomic gambles\\n\\n“We remain very skeptical that tariffs will trigger a large wave of reshoring, given the huge labor cost savings available by producing goods overseas, as well as uncertainty about how long protectionist policies will last,” Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note.\\n\\nThe White House pushed back on criticism Friday. Top Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller declared on Fox News that “changes in advanced manufacturing technology, 3D printing, robotics, artificial intelligence” make it “more and more affordable to manufacture, produce and build at scale in the United States.”\\n\\nWith his tariff strategy, Trump is betting both economically and politically that any short-term pain over tariffs is worth it for a restructured U.S. economy. Early in his presidency, President Joe Biden made a similar gamble, passing a series of infrastructure and pandemic relief bills that he said would eventually boost the economy even as Americans grappled with inflation.\\n\\nIn Biden’s case, voters did not see impacts quickly enough to inspire them to hand control of Washington to Democrats in 2024. Trump is constitutionally prohibited from serving a third term. But if voters sour on his policies, that could spell trouble for his party in the 2026 midterm elections or the 2028 presidential race.\\n\\n“It makes people nervous,” said Dennis Darnoi, a Republican strategist in Michigan, where there will be a race for an open Senate seat and governor in 2026. He said the question is where political moderates land on Trump’s policies. “How long are they going to give him before things start to sour?”\\n\\nA CBS poll released before the tariff announcement showed that 55% of Americans though that the Trump administration was focused too much on tariffs and 64% thought they were not focused enough on lowering prices. That poll also showed that just 23% thought that Trump’s financial policies are making them financially better off.\\n\\nAftershocks were evident immediately for manufacturers after Trump rolled out his plan. Levies rose to 46% on Vietnam, a vital location for Apple Inc. and Nike Inc. Cambodia, where Abercrombie & Fitch Co. gets about one-fifth of its merchandise, faces a 49% rate. Indonesia, where Japan’s Panasonic Holdings Corp. operates, was hit with a 32% charge.\\n\\nJay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers said in a statement that the tariffs “threaten investment, jobs, supply chains and, in turn, America’s ability to outcompete other nations.”\\n\\nScott Paul, who heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a partnership of the steelworkers union and manufacturers, was more bullish.\\n\\n“There will be adjustment. This will take more than hours or days. It will take more than weeks months or longer,” he said. “I actually think moving forward that things are going to get better, not worse.”\\n\\nExemptions sought\\n\\nBefore the tariff announcement, some companies sought to boost investments in the U.S. Hyundai Motor Co. announced plans to build a new steel plant in Louisiana last month and did an event with Trump at the White House.\\n\\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai cited investments from companies like Apple and Hyundai as “indicative of how this administration is working with the private sector while implementing President Trump’s pro-growth, pro-worker America First agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts, and the unleashing of American energy.”\\n\\nStill, one emerging challenge to bringing manufacturing back is Trump’s own tariffs, companies say.\\n\\nIn recent months, businesses have filed hundreds of requests to the U.S. Trade Representative for exemptions on China tariffs for machinery needed to set up U.S. production lines and that they say cannot be sourced domestically.\\n\\nAmong them is Tesla Inc., led by Trump adviser Elon Musk. Tesla filed a series of requests for exclusions just two days before Trump announced his latest duties, arguing that exemptions would help them boost manufacturing in the U.S.\\n\\nAnother issue is whether the U.S. has the workers to staff more manufacturing facilities. There were 482,000 open manufacturing jobs in February, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In a survey of manufacturers conducted by NAM in the first quarter of 2025, 48.4% cited attracting and retaining a quality workforce as a challenge. And Trump’s crackdown on immigration could also slow labor force growth.\\n\\nLooking ahead, Trump is hoping to further juice economic growth with an upcoming tax bill. But economists at the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office have cautioned that an extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts won’t yield much economic growth because it mainly lowers individual taxes, rather than business levies.\\n\\nRepublicans are still debating what will be included in the bill, but the legislation will likely heavily tilt toward rate cuts and deductions for households, rather than big reductions for corporations.', category='business', publish_date='2025-04-05 21:22:51', authors=['Bloomberg News']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Internewscast Journal\\n\\nInternewscast\\n\\n\\nThe Washington DC housing market is in a standstill as federal employees&#8217;&#8230;\\n\\n\\nThis Post: The City&#8217;s Housing Market at Risk Due to Elon Musk&#8217;s Influence first appeared on Internewscast Journal', image='https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/02/17/96839161-14563423-image-a-92_1743613194027.jpg', sentiment=0.013, language='en', video=None, title='The City’s Housing Market at Risk Due to Elon Musk’s Influence', url='https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/the-citys-housing-market-at-risk-due-to-elon-musks-influence/', source_country='us', id=308091744, text='The Washington DC housing market is in a standstill as federal employees’ cushy salaries are still under threat by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts. \\n\\nMore than 25,000 rental properties and 9,800 homes are listed in the DC Metro area, with nearly 10,000 rentals and 500 homes just in the District of Columbia alone as of early April, according to Zillow. \\n\\nAnd although Spring is always a hot time on the market for sellers, buyers are hesitant to snap up homes as their federal and federally-adjacent jobs are still under the threat of massive layoffs as Musk worked to dismantle the government sector. \\n\\n‘[There’s a] fear of making big purchases,’ Charlie Latimer, 31, a DC-area lender, told DailyMail.com. ‘People are afraid of a recession.’ \\n\\nRoughly 40 to 50 percent of Latimer’s customers’ professions have some connection to the government and he found his clients were holding off on getting loans for their homes due to the uncertainty in the job market. \\n\\nAnd roughly 20 percent of his clients have a ‘fear of getting laid off’, he told DailyMail.com. \\n\\nLatimer and Keller Williams Realtor, Omer Reshid, 24, are seeing potential homebuyers being a ‘little more scared’ to seal the deal. \\n\\nPeople are ‘reconsidering their entire life structure’, right now, Reshid, who has worked in real estate for six years, told DailyMail.com. \\n\\nCorcoran Realtor, David Howell, 69, agreed, saying the market has ‘soften[ed] a bit’ over the fear of job insecurity. \\n\\n‘People [who are] uncertain tend not to make big life decisions,’ he told DailyMail.com. ‘The market is still hot, just a little cooler.’ \\n\\nKeller Williams owner, Kymber Menkiti agreed, saying most people who are facing layoffs aren’t going to quickly offload and many will weigh their options. \\n\\n‘You don’t put your house on the market seven days after a layoff,’ she said. ‘That’s not driving it.’\\n\\nPotential homebuyers are also hesitating as they wait for a recession to come full-throttle in hopes that homes rates will significantly decrease like in 2008. However, Latimer and Reshid don’t think they will. \\n\\n‘The best time to buy a house was five years ago,’ Latimer said. \\n\\n‘We don’t see prices coming down,’ Reshid said. ‘Everyone is holding off until the rates come down.’ \\n\\nReshid recommends buying a home when your find it, rather than waiting for a miracle, and Menkiti agreed, as refinancing is always an option if you’re playing the ‘long game’. \\n\\nHowever, despite what social media says, the DC housing market is not about to collapse, although there was a ‘slight’ uptick in offloads after the election. \\n\\n‘But nothing too significant,’ Reshid told DailyMail.com. ‘Every time administration changes, you’re going to see people coming in and coming out.’ \\n\\nNew listings are up 40 percent in the Greater DC Region compared to a year ago, according to Bright MLS statistics. \\n\\nHowever, new pending contracts are up five percent and showings are up nearly 13 percent, compared to last year. \\n\\nReshid said there was a bigger spring market in 2024 than what they’re seeing in 2025. \\n\\n‘It’s a seasonal trend,’ Menkiti, who started her real estate career in 2007, said. ‘It’s really not tied to the federal change.’ \\n\\nHowell, who has studied the DC market every election since 2000, also agrees. Rarely does the market drastically change when the administration does – regardless of political party. \\n\\nIn fact, he said the only reason the market has seen an uptick this time around is due to the Trump Administration drastically cutting the federal workforce. Musk announced on Wednesday that he would step down from DOGE. \\n\\n‘Political elections have very little impact,’ he said. ‘The only difference in this election is the objectives [of the administration].’ \\n\\nHowever, he also admitted it’s too early tell how the gigantic cuts to the federal workforce will truly impact the DC region, as right now, laid off workers are hunkering down and trying to figure it out. \\n\\nThere was a slight upward trend of federal remote workers looking for places to live in the DC area as work-from-home policies were rapidly shifting in the government. Latimer found that those clients weren’t hesitating to sign loans like those who already live in the area. \\n\\nAlthough the trend has started to veer off as the policy becomes more clear to workers, Menkiti said. \\n\\n‘[It’s a] little bit of whiplash,’ Menkiti told DailyMail.com. \\n\\nOverall, all four told DailyMail.com that the biggest obstacle for DC buyers and renters is affordability as the metropolitan area is facing a crisis in that regard. And that there’s a lot of uncertainty in the market right now that is stressing it as people become immobilized by fear. \\n\\nAs for people hightailing it out of the metropolitan, it’s not a huge amount, according to Howell and Menkiti. \\n\\n‘It’s not a tsunami, it’s not a wave, it’s a ripple of people leaving,’ Howell said. ‘Not much of an exodus.

Media attention in major outlets such as the Financial Times and Bloomberg have been highlighting the stock price’s strange twists and turns.\\n\\nThe behavior of the company’s stock price stems from its movements being at stark odds with underlying fundamentals. There are compelling reasons to infer that the price-fundamentals gap might be part psychological and part manipulation.\\n\\nHyperbole is a psychological phenomenon. An article that appeared in the Financial Times explicitly mentions hyperbole as being one of Tesla’s major assets. This article refers to after-hours traders parking fundamentals and instead trading on vibes.\\n\\nConsider the following line in the song “I Dreamed a Dream” from the musical Les Misérables: “But the tigers come at night, with their voices soft as thunder.” These tigers serve as a metaphor for market participants who are engaged in manipulative trading activities in the after-market. The Financial Times asks whether something else is going on with overnight trading in Tesla’s stock, besides vibes.\\n\\nAn article that appeared in Bloomberg discusses whether the “something else” might be price manipulation by quantitative market-neutral trading firms. The alleged manipulation involves these firms inflating their portfolios around the opening of the market, and reducing the inflated positions around the same day close.\\n\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n\\nMicrosoft Warns 240 Million Windows Users—Stop Using Your PC\\n\\n‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Saturday, April 5\\n\\nTrump Tells Americans To \\'Hang Tough\\' After Liberation Day Tariffs Wipe Trillions From Stock Market\\n\\nPrice-Fundamentals Gap\\n\\nJPMorgan analysts have been tracking Tesla’s price-fundamentals gap for over a decade. The Financial Times interviewed its lead analyst Ryan Brinkman. Brinkman has been bearish on the stock for several years. His approach to fundamentals-based valuation centers on free cash flow analysis. Free cash flows are defined as the amount of cash a company generates in period of time (such as a year), which is available to be paid to both the company’s debtholders and shareholders. The fundamental value of the company’s stock is determined by the portion of the free cash flows available to be paid just to the shareholders.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley sell-side analysts also assess Tesla’s price-fundamental gap using free cash flows. Notably, the Morgan Stanley analysts have been more bullish on Tesla’s fundamentals than their JPMorgan counterparts. To see why, consider the chart below. The chart depicts the free cash flow forecasts developed in 2020 by the teams at the two firms, for the period 2020 through 2035. Notice that after 2021, the Morgan Stanley forecasts lie above the JPMorgan counterparts.\\n\\nTesla\\'s Free Cash Flows Over Time. Forecasts by JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, 2020-2035, along with ... More actual values, 2020-2024.\\nHersh Shefrin\\n\\nOn a technical point, I should mention that analysts rarely report the values associated with the constant growth portions of their forecasts, called the “terminal horizon forecasts.” I have constructed these values by using inferential formulas. Notably, most of Tesla’s fundamental value relates to the terminal horizon.\\n\\nThe free cash flow chart also displays the value of Tesla’s actual free cash flows for the period 202 through 2024. In fact, the chart displays two actual free cash flow streams. The first is labeled FCF and the second is labeled FCF:Capex. FCF are the cash flows that conform to the definition of free cash flow provided above, namely the amount of cash a company generates over time, which is available to be paid to both the company’s debtholders and shareholders. A key term in the formula for FCF is cash flow from investment. In practice, analysts use capital expenditure in place of cash flow from investment; and therefore, FCF:Capex does the same.\\n\\nThe chart indicates that analysts at JPMorgan underestimated Tesla’s FCF:Capex for the entire period 2021 through 2024, while the analysts at Morgan Stanley underestimated Tesla’s FCF:Capex for 2021 and 2022, and overestimated FCF:Capex in 2023 and 2024.\\n\\nAs for the period after 2024, a report in Seeking Alpha describes a pessimistic sales outlook for Tesla. The article emphasizes the damage to Tesla’s brand, stemming from the role of Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk in mass U.S. government layoffs. Extrapolating the FCF:Capex chart for the period 2025 through 2035 suggests that the JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley forecasts might both prove to be highly optimistic.\\n\\nEven more important is that the actual free cash flow stream, FCF, lies well below the FCF:Capex stream. In fact, FCF is negative for 2023 and 2024. This means that during 2023 and 2024, the direction of cash flow was from the debtholders and shareholders of Tesla to the company, not the reverse. In reality, both analyst teams overestimated Tesla’s free cash flows in the years 2022, 2023, and 2024.\\n\\nThe upshot of this free cash flow overestimation is that analysts have been overestimating Tesla’s fundamental value for years. I made this point previously, in a post titled “How Overvalued Is Tesla’s Stock, Really?” As for hyperbole and psychology, I made this point in a post entitled “Tesla’s Powerful Narrative Is Propelling Its Stock Price.”\\n\\nSince mid-December, Tesla’s stock has fallen by 51% at a time when the S&P 500 has fallen by 16%. Yet, as the Seeking Alpha article reminds us, Tesla’s market cap still exceeds the combined market caps of Toyota, Ferrari, General Motors, Honda, Stellantis, and Ford Motor.\\n\\nPrice Manipulation\\n\\nThe manipulation contention about Tesla’s stock has been advanced compellingly by Bruce Knuteson, the CEO of Kn-X. The type of manipulation involves a trader increasing a security in his or her portfolio at the open, when liquidity is low, in order to drive up the price of the security. The trader then sells the security at the close, when liquidity is higher. Because of the difference in liquidity, the consequent decrease in price at the close is smaller in magnitude than the increase in price at the open, and so, as a result, the value of the trader’s portfolio increases .\\n\\nKnuteson analyzed the difference between the behavior of Tesla’s stock overnight, between the prior day close and the next day’s opening, and the behavior during trading day between open and close. Traders who bought at the open and sold at the close, from the time Tesla went public in 2010, would have earned an average return of -2.7 basis points per trading session. Had they instead bought at the close and sold at the open, they would have earned, on average, 18.4 basis points per (after-market) session.\\n\\nThe difference in returns is colossal. The chart below displays the cumulative effect of doing these trades daily, beginning in 2010. Ignoring trading costs, overnight trading results in an initial dollar investment being worth $1,145 today. In contrast, that same dollar invested intraday over the same period would have shrunk to 61 cents. Notice that the two series in the chart relate to different vertical axes. If both series were graphed using a single vertical axis, the (blue) intraday series would hug the horizontal axis.\\n\\nCumulative returns to Tesla for the overnight (after-market) period and the intraday (trading ... More session) period.\\nHersh Shefrin\\n\\nBecause the trading day session is shorter than the after-hours session, it is reasonable to expect a higher return from the after-hours session. However, the numbers for Tesla clearly do not stem from a difference in trading session length. In addition, trading costs are large enough to prevent an arbitrage opportunity here.\\n\\nThe Bloomberg article mentioned above points out that Knuteson has been arguing, for almost a decade, that the overnight trading puzzle is widespread and stems from market manipulation. The Bloomberg article also mentions a recent publication in the Journal of Investment Management by Victor Haghani, Vladimir Ragulin and Richard Dewey. Their work, which received the Harry Markowitz Best JOIM Paper Award this year, provides an explanation for the phenomenon based on the trading of “meme stocks.”\\n\\nThe “meme stock” argument involves individual investors choosing stocks mostly when not at work and markets are closed, and placing trade orders to be executed at the open. In a rejoinder, Knuteson explains why he finds the meme stock explanation unconvincing. Indeed, he discusses a range of possible alternative explanations, and concludes that only manipulation can account for the full extent of the phenomenon.\\n\\nIssue Intersection, Psychology, And Incentives\\n\\nThe two issues, price-valuation gap and manipulation, come together in interesting ways. During regular trading hours, it is as if traders fully appreciate that Tesla’s stock price is overvalued relative to fundamentals. As a result, returns during trading hours are typically negative. In addition, the return standard deviations per session, are larger for intraday than overnight, 2.8% as opposed to 2.1%. This means that intraday trading features lower returns and higher volatility. In this respect, keep in mind that according to textbook theory, returns and risk should be positively correlated, not the reverse. This is one reason why behavioral finance, not traditional finance, is better at explaining the financial world.\\n\\nThe same two issues come together in respect to persistence of the phenomenon over time, psychological denial, and private interests. In respect to the price-valuation gap, for almost two decades, analysts have resisted the contention that their free cash flow-based valuations are upwardly biased. I have documented this issue in JOIM, in the Journal of Portfolio Management, and on my Forbes blog.\\n\\nIn respect to manipulation, Knuteson points out that the overnight return puzzle applies broadly, including to the S&P 500. In an email exchange with me, he reports the arithmetic means and standard deviations for each of the two S&P 500 SPDR ETF series, for the time period January 29, 1993 through March 31, 2025. These are respectively 4 basis points (mean) and 67 basis points (standard deviation) for overnight, and 0.5 basis points (mean) and 96 basis points (standard deviation) for intraday.\\n\\nThe difference in means, when compounded, are colossal. Knuteson asks why this phenomenon, which is stark, widespread, and documented, has gained such little attention from regulators, academics, and investors. The Bloomberg article applies the term “conspiracy theory” to the manipulation claim. In his rejoinder to the Bloomberg article, Knuteson makes the following remarks, where references to [8], [2022], and [2023] refer to his posts and other comments.\\n\\n“By far the biggest conspiracy here is the years-long decision by regulators, other government officials, economists, journalists, finance industry professionals, and others to hide these strikingly suspicious return patterns and the apparent absence of any innocuous explanation for them from the public at large. This conspiracy is genuinely astounding. But it isn\\'t a theory. It is an objective, indisputable fact. I have extensively documented it (including in the public thread with the SEC and others made available with [2023]). The years-long hiding of these strikingly suspicious return patterns from the public is a historic conspiracy regardless of what the correct explanation for these suspicious return patterns turns out to be. The aspect of this problem most deserving the term \"conspiracy\" is the indisputable fact that the public at large still (still!) has absolutely no idea these suspicious return patterns that nobody can innocuously explain even exist [8]. Of course, as I point out in [2023] and elsewhere, this well-documented, objectively factual, undisputed, still (still!) ongoing \"conspiracy\" requires no large, secret, sinister network -- just a bunch of people with bad incentives who lack the integrity to do the right thing.”\\n\\nCognitive dissonance, motivated reasoning, and the pressure to conform are powerful psychological forces that can prevent people from accepting the truth. Cognitive dissonance is about resolving conflicts in information by choosing what is most comfortable. Motivated reasoning is about rationalizing such a choice, when that comfort is connected to incentives. The pressure to conform is about the discomfort that comes from expressing dissent within a group.\\n\\nHyping stocks and overvaluation relative to fundamentals leads people to feel more comfortable than if stocks were fairly priced. Ignoring the price-valuation gap can be viewed as cognitive dissonance. Ignoring that the bulk of stock returns arrive in the dark of night is a form of motivated reasoning. As for the pressure to conform, Knuteson suggests the following about those working for firms engaged in the alleged manipulation.\\n\\n“at some point, a quant who has been around long enough has acquired a sufficiently informed understanding of the group\\'s activities to recognize the problem and its serious implications. Most quants at that point won\\'t speak up -- social pressure, good pay, the plausible deniability afforded by willful blindness, and the absence of an obviously effective way to address the problem will together be more than enough to keep almost anyone quiet.”\\n\\nThe valuation of Tesla is fascinating, and in respect to psychological forces at work, it is just the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\nFollow me on Twitter.\\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades', category=None, publish_date='2025-04-05 21:08:16', authors=['Anna Moneymaker', 'Contributor', 'Hersh Shefrin']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Hundreds of thousands gather for the largest opposition protest since the inauguration', image='https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HandsOffProtestDC-1.jpg', sentiment=-0.291, language='en', video=None, title='Anti-Trump Protesters Assemble in Every State and Cities Worldwide', url='https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-protests-america-world-hands-off-1235311342/', source_country='us', id=308110136, text='WASHINGTON — From Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, Topeka, Kansas to Chicago and several of its suburbs, in all 50 states and in many cities worldwide, hundreds of thousands of people assembled to protest against Donald Trump and his billionaire financier and adviser Elon Musk on Saturday.\\n\\n The “Hands Off” protests included around 1,200 demonstrations planned in advance, according to organizers, with more than half a million people RSVPing to attend the marches and protests, which looked to be the largest single day of protest since Trump took office. Per the event’s website, more than 150 groups signed on to participate. \\n\\n In Washington, D.C., where more than 20,000 people were expected to attend the rally held at the National Mall, people held signs protesting the massive cuts to federal agencies, including health and Social Security workers; defending constitutional rights, which have been under threat from the administration and Trump’s executive orders; and supporting human rights for immigrants, women, and trans people. \\n\\n “NOT PAID AND PISSED OFF,” read one sign, a reference to Musk’s baseless claims that protests against him are being funded by liberal billionaire George Soros. One man hefted a model of a human spine onto a pole. “HEY GOP, WHERE’S YOURS?” read the accompanying sign. One of the chants which received a big reaction from the crowd was when someone began calling out “Where is Congress?” to which the crowd shouted back, “Do your job!” Protesters’ reasons for attending the event varied widely, with the thousands who flocked to the National Mall on Saturday being fueled by various degrees of frustration, grief, outrage, and outright anger. \\n\\n One couple, both veterans who served in Afghanistan, told Rolling Stone that they were “extremely pissed off” about Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s treatment of military service members. Veterans make up nearly a third of the federal workforce, so they have been disproportionately affected by Trump and Musk’s job cuts, as well as those to the Department of Veterans Affairs. \\n\\n One protester was motivated by the Trump administration’s recent Signal scandal, in which Hegseth shared sensitive details about America’s planned attacks on the Houthis in Yemen in advance with other officials — as well as a journalist from The Atlantic. \\n\\n “I was a special operations aviator,” the protester said, “if I had released a timeline the way [Hegseth] did for a mission, I would be in jail. Fuck that guy.” \\n\\n Rolling Stone spoke to several current and former federal workers who felt it was their duty to speak out against the administration’s hatchet job cuts to all manner of executive departments and government programs. “I still have my job right now, but it’s so tenuous because I don’t know what’s going to happen. I figured I need to be out here and show that we actually matter,” one current government employee said. \\n\\n Another protester — whose concerns were echoed in hundreds of signs and banners — said that he was “most opposed to the violations of due process” being carried out against immigrants and pro-Palestinian protesters by the Trump administration. “Without due process, nothing matters. None of us are citizens, none of us have rights if they’re unwilling to allow us to defend ourselves in the court of law,” they said. \\n\\n One young woman, who grew emotional during a conversation with Rolling Stone, said she attended the protest after hearing Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) read a portion of a letter from a constituent during his record-breaking protest speech earlier this week. \\n\\n “Not only is the U.S. not stronger, not safer, not more prosperous, but the beacon of our democracy grows dim across the globe,” she quoted, explaining: “That really hit me. I feel like what’s happening right now is not what America means to us, or at least to me. The way we’re just treating people is very inhuman, and I feel like we need more empathy.” \\n\\n “They’re eating checks, they’re eating balances” was one popular sign seen across protests nationwide — a reference to Trump’s maliciously false claim in a presidential debate that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating dogs and cats. Some signs mentioned Trump’s tariff announcement this week, which sent the markets tumbling. Others were direct calls to fire Trump and Musk, many spoke for democracy, railed against fascism, or simply said “No King” and “Fuck Trump.”\\n\\n In Portland, Maine, Rolling Stone witnessed hundreds of protesters lining both sides of Congress Street. Protesters held signs such as “Keep Your Fascist Hands Off My Social Security” and “Hands Off Health Care.” Another sign said, “Send Elon to Mars.” (Musk wants to colonize Mars with his space company, SpaceX.) The protest caused Maine’s equivalent of a traffic jam, as cars streamed in from all directions.\\n\\n Meanwhile, protests took place worldwide. In European cities, hundreds also gathered against Trump and Musk in the wake of the global tariffs that tanked financial markets earlier this week. In Berlin, Germany, protesters chanted, “Fuck you, Elon” as hundreds rallied outside of a showroom for Tesla, Musk’s electric vehicle company. Protests in Australia and New Zealand were also held outside of Tesla showrooms.\\n\\n In London, people chanted “Hands off” and “Donald Trump has got to go” in Trafalgar Square. “The most important office in democracy is the citizen,” one sign read, while another said: “Party for democracy.” In Paris, protesters assembled on the Place de la République, where they held signs saying “Drump Trump,” “Hate never ‘made America great again,’” and “Hands off Canada, Hands off the EU, Hands off Greenland, Hands off Gaza, Hands off Ukraine, Hands off our Freedoms, Hands off Education.”\\n\\n “Every single day it seems like [Trump] starts doing things on a whim. You don’t really know what he’s going to do. It doesn’t seem like he knows what he’s going to do,” one woman told Spanish sports newspaper Diaro AS. “He also lets himself be influenced by other dangerous people — people with money … He’s not thinking about [the] people, he’s thinking about his billionaire buddies. There’s no limit to the issues that he’s causing.”', category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-05 20:49:12', authors=['Althea Legaspi', 'Andrew Perez', 'Nikki McCann Ramirez']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Anti-Trump protesters gathered at hundreds of locations nationwide  USA Today', image='https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/05/USAT/82953220007-xxx-04052025-south-bend-hands-off-protest-10.JPG?crop=2763,1555,x0,y144&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp', sentiment=-0.033, language='en', video=None, title='Anti-Trump protesters gathered at hundreds of locations nationwide - USA Today', url='https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/05/trump-protest-rallies-hands-off/82868543007/', source_country='us', id=308143778, text='Thousands protested across the U.S. on Saturday against President Trump\\'s policies and actions.Protesters voiced concerns over cuts to education, social security, tariffs and potential threats to democracy.Protesters also objected to the role billionaire Elon Musk has played in Trump\\'s government.\\n\\nWASHINGTON, D.C. ‒ Tens of thousands of people are gathering Saturday at rallies across the country to voice concerns over President Donald Trump\\'s actions since taking office.\\n\\nThe \"Hands Off\" protests are expected to be the largest and most numerous protests since Trump\\'s second term began. Nationwide more than 500,000 people have RSVP\\'d to attend one of 1,000 rallies marches or protests organized by grassroots groups. The biggest protest was expected to be in D.C..\\n\\nBy 1 p.m. Eastern, protesters stretched as far as the eye could see along the National Mall and the crowd had been flowing toward the base of the Washington monument for hours. Metro Police were forced to shut down 14th street, a major road across the National Mall, because so many pedestrians were crossing.\\n\\nPeople were waving American flags and Ukrainian flags. They carried signs protesting cuts to the Education Department and Social Security, supporting trans rights and urging people to vote and defend the Constitution. Some played drums and shouted from bull horns. Toddlers rode tricycles or their parents\\' shoulders. Dogs wore shirts declaring themselves \"dogs against DOGE.\"\\n\\nThe White House had earlier dismissed the protests, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt telling USA TODAY this week that \"protests, lawsuits, and lawfare\" will not sway Trump \"from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable.\" Trump was not in D.C. Saturday, though protests were expected near his estate in Mar-a-Lago, Florida.\\n\\nLuella Jaslowski, 59, of Twin Lakes, Wisc. said she and her sister jumped to buy plane tickets to Washington when they learned about the Hands Off protest two weeks ago. She said it was important to be there in person, even if Trump is not in Washington.\\n\\n\"I want to be here. I know he\\'s not here, but I want to be here because this is where democracy starts,\" she told USA TODAY.\\n\\nShe said she hopes people see the size of the opposition to Trump and opposition to Elon Musk, who has led the Department of Government Efficiency, which has cut tends of thousands of federal jobs.\\n\\nBut Lee Eiden, 72, works at the National Institutes of Health and said it was time to stand up and say something.\\n\\n\"The reductions in force have been so indiscriminate and clumsily laid out that we\\'re actually endangering health and safety and the protection of federal property,\" he said.\\n\\nRenée Beaver, 45, of Washington, DC had friends come down from Philadelphia for the protest.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know how much an actual protest can change Donald Trump\\'s mind about anything, but getting out with people and engaging in solidarity activities, I think, is good for everyone\\'s spirit, and also shows that there is an opposition, that there are people that don\\'t like what\\'s going on,\" she said.\\n\\nAcross the country ‒ and the world\\n\\nMore than 1,200 other protests were planned across the country. Organizers said they wanted to have protests that are not only accessible for people wherever they are in the country, but also highly visible to show that opposition exists in every part of the country.\\n\\nIn Erie, Pennsylania, for instance, a crowd estimated by organizers to number more than 700 gathered in the city\\'s Perry Square. About 200 stood on the Roosevelt Bridge in Stuart, Florida, roughly an hour\\'s drive north of Mar-a-Lago. In Sedona, Arizona, well over 500 protesters marched through downtown with chants of “Deport Musk.” In Providence, Rhode Island, a crowd estimated at 6,000 met at Hope High School at noon and then marched down Thayer Street and Angell Street to Burnside Park, joined by brass bands.\\n\\nIn York, Pennsylvania, well over 700 people stood on the four quadrants of the square named in honor of the Continental Congress’ nine-month stay in York during the Revolutionary War. The peaceful protesters waved signs targeting Trump and Musk.\\n\\nAnd some even wore costumes. Caro Stowell of Thomasville was dressed up like a clown.\\n\\n“I came out because we have elected a clown, and now we have a circus,” she said as cars drove past beeping their horns in support of the rally.\\n\\nStowell said she believes the administration is destroying education and health care. “You can see all the people here who are not happy with what’s happening to our Constitution,” she said motioning toward the crowd.\\n\\nThousands of protesters also gathered Saturday in Berlin, Paris and London to rally against Trump and Musk.\\n\\nIn February alone, more than 2,085 protests took place nationwide, according to the Crowd Counting Consortium, a joint project of Harvard Kennedy School and the University of Connecticut.\\n\\nThat\\'s an increase from 937 protests in February 2017, the first full month of the first Trump administration. But many of the protests in the early months of Trump\\'s first term were much larger than the nation has seen so far in 2025, and there has been less frequent media coverage of protests this year.\\n\\nMoveOn Executive Director Rahna Epting said the goal was to concentrate all of those protests into one day to show how many Americans oppose cuts to critical services and benefits they\\'ve earned like Medicare.\\n\\n\"Hands Off is like hands off on all these things, not just our services and benefits, but our rights and our freedoms, all of which are being threatened right now, and we\\'re seeing it every single day,” she said. \\n\\nAll of Saturday\\'s protests were reported to be peaceful with almost no counter-protesters and only a small number of arrests.\\n\\nIn downtown Appleton, Wisconsin, a man was arrested just moments after the protest began.\\n\\nAccording to bystanders, the man pulled a Tesla driver, Matt Simon, out of his car and punched him in the face while protesters nearby chanted “Peaceful! Peaceful!” The Tesla driver’s wife, Edie Simon, who was there to protest, said her husband bought the Tesla three years ago and was driving it for Uber because he was out of work.\\n\\n“We’re anti-Trump, anti-Musk in every way,” she said.\\n\\nThe issues: Standing up for democracy\\n\\nCC Kay of Silver Spring, MD said she came to the Washington monument protest because \"either I do this or I stay in bed depressed.\"\\n\\nThe issue she was there to raise was voting rights.\\n\\n\"Protesting is the way I can scream. And I just feel that voting underscores everything. Everything. Without the vote, we get nothing. We have to make voting the number one priority,\" she said.\\n\\nEd Jeffries, 74, of Poland, Ohio said he feels like Trump is robbing America of its democracy.\\n\\n\"We\\'re losing it in this country, and we need to start fighting back. He has too many people that are just siding with him,\" Jeffries said. \"Somebody has to stand up, and that\\'s what we\\'re here for.\"\\n\\nAnn Berger, 78, of Stuart, Florida, who lives half the year in Wisconsin, said she was protesting at the Roosevelt Bridge over the recent Wisconsin Supreme Court election in which a candidate backed by Musk lost.\\n\\n“Elon Musk came in and put $28 million in, and offered millions of dollars for votes, and I think that’s wrong,” Berger said. “We are not for sale. That’s not the way our government should run.”\\n\\nShe felt a \"duty\" to attend Saturday’s protest in Stuart.\\n\\n“We all should be speaking out; we all should be speaking our piece,” she said. “We should be respectful and listen to each other, but we need to speak the truth. There’s too much fear going on.”\\n\\nJoan Kelly, 60, of Port St. Lucie, who also attended the Florida protest, felt similarly.\\n\\n“Today I am standing up for myself, my daughters, my grandchildren, all of our rights,” Kelly said as she grabbed a chair from her car. “I just think what\\'s going on in America today is so sad and it\\'s confusing. It\\'s just scary and confusing, to be honest.”\\n\\nHer friend, Amy Morgan, 61, also of Port St. Lucie, nodded her head as Kelly spoke.\\n\\n“It’s just terrifying. I\\'m just scared and upset and angry and I just feel like I’ve got to do something,” Morgan said. “Sitting back and hoping isn\\'t working.”\\n\\nProtesting federal cutbacks\\n\\nFormer federal employee Lisa Gibbon used to work in HR and said Trump violated proper procedures for laying off federal employees.\\n\\n\"I know the right way to do these things and the wrong way, and this was the wrong way,\" she said.\\n\\nShe traveled into the D.C. from Frederick County, Maryland,, for the protest.\\n\\n\"I\\'m here to do my little part, because I don\\'t have a lot of power, but I want to join those who do to save our country from those who are trying to destroy it,\" she said.\\n\\nSam Lau of Dover sat in a wheelchair in York, Pennsylvania, wearing a mask and holding a sign that said “Hands off Medicaid.” She said she feels the administration is targeting the federal program designed to cover medical costs for people with limited income and resources.\\n\\n“I’m on Medicaid. This is not me being dramatic here. I will die without it,” she said, noting that she needs “thousands of dollars of medications and treatments each month that keep me alive. Without Medicaid, it’s just going to be a quick death.”\\n\\nMark Askew, 67, said the workforce cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs and Trump\\'s firing of Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are what motivated him to attend Saturday\\'s event in his hometown of Cincinnati. It marked his first time at a protest.\\n\\nAskew, a Navy veteran, described Trump\\'s removal of Gen. Brown as \"basically racist.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like the fact that he feels that all veterans are suckers,\" Askew continued. \"He\\'s cutting VA benefits and reducing government workers who are veterans … I just think that somebody needs to do something, that\\'s why I\\'m here.\"\\n\\nHe added that he loved experiencing his first protest.\\n\\n\"The rain is probably going to have me sneezing tomorrow, but I enjoy it,\" Askew said before adjusting the grip on his sign, which read \"Trump hates veterans because they are brave and he is a coward.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s the economy\\n\\nIn Boca Raton, Matthew Kass, a former Republican town council member from Chester, N.J., carried a sign reading “TARIFFS KILL JOBS!” on one side, and the other, “END THE TRADE WAR! NO MORE DOGE! FIRE MUSK! DUMP TRUMP!”\\n\\nMusk is canceling federal contracts with companies, with Trump’s approval, and giving his own company that money. “It’s corruption before our very eyes,” said the retired bonds trader.\\n\\nWhat keeps him optimistic, Kass, 67, of Boynton Beach said, is seeing the protesting crowds and Republicans losing at the ballot box in smaller elections since November. \\n\\nKaren Shernit 57, and her sister Susan, 64, attended the rally in Detroit in part to mark the fifth anniversary of their mother\\'s death from COVID-19.\\n\\nKaren Shernit said she protested to fight her own feelings of helplessness, in addition to her many complaints about Trump,\\n\\n\"You could name anything, from the economy, tariffs, health insurance, Elon Musk, who is not elected to any office, just taking jobs away from people and just dismantling our entire federal government leaves me terrified,\" she said.\\n\\nConcerned about cruelty\\n\\nOutside the Indiana capitol building in Indianapolis, Gwyn Skrobul, 62, worried that cuts to Social Security and Medicare would harm her 95-year-old mother.\\n\\nThe retired history teacher said she\\'s concerned the past could be repeating itself.\\n\\n\"The whole targeting minorities and polarizing the community – it\\'s looking very Nazi-esque to me, which is frightening. I don\\'t want to leave this kind of a world to my children, grandchildren,\" Skrobul said.\\n\\nHer husband, Guy Skrobul, 62, spent his career as a special education teacher.\\n\\n\"The minute that he mocked a reporter with a physical handicap – that was it. The hateful rhetoric. The injustice. Relishing in cruelty toward other people is wrong.\"\\n\\nCarla Greenfield, 67, who joined a protest in Rochester, New York said she felt the need to express her frustration Saturday.“I feel like we need to take control and let them know how we\\'re feeling,” said Greenfield, who voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last fall\\'s election because she was concerned about Trump\\'s apparent lack of empathy. “I have friends that are veterans that are in VA hospitals and they\\'re lacking services. I\\'ve had family members with cancer, that is losing the research that\\'s necessary for them,\" she said. \"I was in education for my whole career and it kills me to see them potentially taking services away from children and affecting civil rights, especially children special needs.”\\n\\nMelissa Holsman contributed to this report from Stuart, Florida, Chris Persaud from Boca Raton, Florida, Scott Fisher from York, Pennsylvania, Antonia Noori Farzan from Providence, Rhode Island, Ryan Murphy from Indianapolis, Kerria Weaver from Rochester, New York, Grace Tucker from Cincinnati, Rebecca Loroff from Appleton, Wisconsin, John Wisely in Detroit, and Laura Gersony and Ronald J.

More than 500,000 people nationwide have RSVP\\'d to attend one of the 1,200 protests in all 50 states, an effort organized by Hands Off!, Indivisible, Move On and other grassroots organizations. By midday, they had taken to the streets in New York, Washington DC, Boston, Atlanta, San Francisco and dozens of other cities from coast to coast. In Los Angeles, several hundred people with signs lined two busy intersections in Los Feliz. “We the people are pissed,” one sign read. “Canada not for sale,” read another. Sporadic chants punctuated a steady stream of tambourines, car horns, applause and cheering. Dunbar Dicks, 47, helped organize the protest. He has volunteered with Indivisible Hollywood since 2016 and said that the group came back to life and “started organizing soon after the inauguration.” The coordinated \"Hands Off!\" protests were the first big demonstrations in opposition to Trump’s second term. “We feel like we have a duty to exercise our first amendment rights and we are just doing this in between our day job and picking our kids up from daycare,” Dicks said. Behind him, dozens chanted “This is what democracy looks like.” Dicks, of Studio City, said that Republicans “are counting on us not to show up.” His main concerns: the “dismantling of the social safety net and governing by fiat.” A larger demonstration and march is planned to start at 4 pm in Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles. \"This mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies,\" according to the event description for the \"Hands Off\" protest. \"Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.\" In Washington D.C., home to the biggest swath of employees whose agencies have been gutted by tech mogul Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, a sea of people swarmed the National Mall, chanting “Hey hey, ho ho, Musk and Trump have got to go!\" Others carried signs reflecting their status as federal workers, including “I took an oath to defend the constitution” and “Feds’ Jobs Matter.” “It does give me hope to see this many people here making this protest,” said Terry Manzo, 86, who sported a hat covered in political pins. “In the D.C. area, there are so many [federal employees] who are so afraid.” Manzo handed out pink postcards she’d handmade to send to elected officials, blasting them for not curtailing the actions of Musk and Trump. Musk\\'s DOGE has led the effort to drastically reduce the scope of the federal government through large-scale job cuts and mass layoffs of tens of thousands of employees. This week, the Trump administration announced that it would impose sweeping tariffs on imports from all countries on Saturday, tanking the stock market, stoking fears of a U.S. recession and raising questions about whether businesses would pass on the higher costs to consumers. Trump also announced Friday that his administration isn\\'t moving forward with a Biden-era proposal that aimed to expand eligibility for anti-obesity drugs to millions of Americans on Medicaid or Medicare. The White House rescheduled spring garden tours intended for Saturday, “out of an abundance of caution and to ensure the safety of all within proximity to public demonstrations planned near the White House,” according to a news release. Whitney Sherman, 38, who traveled from Philadelphia to D.C. for the protest, said she has been despairing over Democrats, who have largely failed to assemble a coordinated response to Trump and Republican-controlled Congress. She pointed to Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who have toured the country in recent weeks for rallies they’ve dubbed “Fighting Oligarchy.” While their events have drawn thousands, they’re only “independent voices,” said Sherman. “For all the bad things you can say about [Republicans], they have rallied around a single person. Not saying falling in line is a good thing … but it’s effective,” she said. “We need our own project 2029.” In Atlanta, thousands marched toward the Georgia State Capitol, holding signs that read, \"Trade war makes us poor\" and \"Honk if you hate Elon Musk.\" David Williams, 79, who attended the rally, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he had built up his retirement savings for more than 45 years. He called the the Trump administration’s handling of the economy, and “attack on Social Security nothing but outrageous.” “They’ve gone way way too far,” he said. “It’s so obvious he’s destroying our basic rights with no regard for the rule of law. He’s a train wreck.”', category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-05 20:37:56', authors=['Faith E.

More by Graeme Sloan for The Washington Post via Getty Images)\\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images\\n\\nMusk, appearing at the meeting Saturday via video conference, spoke with Italy’s far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, stating he believes the United States and Europe should “move ideally, in my view, to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America.”\\n\\nMusk also said he believes workers should be able to move between the United States and the European Union more freely for work opportunities.\\n\\nThe Tesla billionaire said this has “certainly been my advice to the president,” Bloomberg reported, though it was unclear whether he meant his comments on the tariffs or mobility between the United States and European Union, or both.\\n\\nEarlier Saturday, Musk slammed Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, in a post on X, replying to a user who had praised Navarro, a proponent of tariffs: “A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing,” Musk said, slamming Navarro’s elite education, and, “He ain’t built sh—.”\\n\\nHow Much Did Trump Increase Tariffs On The European Union?\\n\\nTrump, during his “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement, said tariffs would increase 20% on the European Union. The tariffs, which are already controversial and have sent shockwaves throughout the global economy, appear likely to provoke an EU response. The 10% baseline tariffs Trump implemented on all imports from most countries took effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. EST, with higher tariffs due to start next week. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU is preparing a response to tariffs Trump had already imposed on steel and aluminum, followed by a second measure in response to the “Liberation Day” tariffs. “We’re now preparing for further countermeasures to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail,” von der Leyen said Thursday. She slammed Trump’s tariff plan as having “no order in the disorder” and “no clear path through the complexity and chaos that is being created.” Other European leaders have also slammed Trump’s EU tariffs, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who called it a “brutal and unfounded decision” that will have a severe impact on Europe and make U.S. consumers “poorer and weaker.” Italy’s far-right prime minister Giorgia Meloni, who is backed by Trump and Musk, said the tariffs are wrong, but said it is “not a catastrophe.”\\n\\nKey Background\\n\\nTrump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs had an immediate impact on the global economy, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to plummet 1,680 points Thursday and another 2,200 points Friday, marking the worst losses since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020 and wiping nearly $5 trillion in market capitalization. Trump has repeatedly defended the tariffs, though he acknowledged the impact “won’t be easy” and urged Americans to “hang tough” in a post on Truth Social on Saturday. Economists have voiced fears about the tariffs’ impact on the global economy, with JPMorgan Chase’s top economist stating the tariffs will bring the United States “perilously close” to a recession.\\n\\nMusk’s appearance at Italy’s League Party event is his latest show of support for the European right wing. Musk previously appeared virtually at a rally for the right-wing Alternative for Germany party ahead of Germany’s February elections, and he has frequently promoted the party, which promotes anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic beliefs, on his X account. Earlier this week, he voiced support for France’s far-right leader Marine Le Pen after her embezzlement conviction. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has called Musk’s support for Europe’s far-right “really disgusting” and “not good for the democratic development in all [of] the European Union.”\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n\\nWorld leaders criticise Trump tariffs as \\'major blow\\' (BBC)\\n\\nTrump Tells Americans To \\'Hang Tough\\' After Liberation Day Tariffs Wipe Trillions From Stock Market (Forbes)\\n\\nFollow me on Twitter.

MoE architectures basically break down data processing tasks into subtasks and then delegate them to smaller, specialized “expert” models. \\n\\nMaverick, for example, has 400 billion total parameters, but only 17 billion active parameters across 128 “experts.” (Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills.) Scout has 17 billion active parameters, 16 experts, and 109 billion total parameters.\\n\\nAccording to Meta’s internal testing, Maverick, which the company says is best for “general assistant and chat” use cases like creative writing, exceeds models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini 2.0 on certain coding, reasoning, multilingual, long-context, and image benchmarks. However, Maverick doesn’t quite measure up to more capable recent models like Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and OpenAI’s GPT-4.5.\\n\\nScout’s strengths lie in tasks like document summarization and reasoning over large codebases. Uniquely, it has a very large context window: 10 million tokens. (“Tokens” represent bits of raw text — e.g. the word “fantastic” split into “fan,” “tas” and “tic.”) In plain English, Scout can take in images and up to millions of words, allowing it to process and work with extremely lengthy documents. \\n\\nScout can run on a single Nvidia H100 GPU, while Maverick requires an Nvidia H100 DGX system or equivalent, according to Meta’s calculations.\\n\\nMeta’s unreleased Behemoth will need even beefier hardware. According to the company, Behemoth has 288 billion active parameters, 16 experts, and nearly two trillion total parameters. Meta’s internal benchmarking has Behemoth outperforming GPT-4.5, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Pro (but not 2.5 Pro) on several evaluations measuring STEM skills like math problem solving. \\n\\nOf note, none of the Llama 4 models is a proper “reasoning” model along the lines of OpenAI’s o1 and o3-mini. Reasoning models fact-check their answers and generally respond to questions more reliably, but as a consequence take longer than traditional, “non-reasoning” models to deliver answers.\\n\\nInterestingly, Meta says that it tuned all of its Llama 4 models to refuse to answer “contentious” questions less often. According to the company, Llama 4 responds to “debated” political and social topics that the previous crop of Llama models wouldn’t. In addition, the company says, Llama 4 is “dramatically more balanced” with which prompts it flat-out won’t entertain.\\n\\n“[Y]ou can count on [Lllama 4] to provide helpful, factual responses without judgment,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “[W]e’re continuing to make Llama more responsive so that it answers more questions, can respond to a variety of different viewpoints […] and doesn’t favor some views over others.”\\n\\nThose tweaks come as some White House allies accuse AI chatbots of being too politically “woke.” \\n\\nMany of President Donald Trump’s close confidants, including billionaire Elon Musk and crypto and AI “czar” David Sacks, have alleged that popular AI chatbots censor conservative views. Sacks has historically singled out OpenAI’s ChatGPT as “programmed to be woke” and untruthful about political subject matter.\\n\\nIn actuality, bias in AI is an intractable technical problem. Musk’s own AI company, xAI, has struggled to create a chatbot that doesn’t endorse some political views over others.\\n\\nThat hasn’t stopped companies including OpenAI from adjusting their AI models to answer more questions than they would have previously, in particular questions relating to controversial subjects.', category=None, publish_date='2025-04-05 20:01:30', authors=['Kyle Wiggers']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='[id=0] DOGE may be an acronym for the Department of Government Efficiency, but it is far from efficient in its plans to cut up to 25% of the IRS staff which include si...', image='https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67f184ffe084b73519571e9c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds', sentiment=0.026, language='en', video=None, title='DOGE IRS Cuts Make No Sense', url='https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveweisman/2025/04/05/doge-irs-cuts-make-no-sense/', source_country='US', id=308083730, text=\"WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 13: A sign for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is seen outside its ...

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)\\nGetty Images\\n\\nDOGE may be an acronym for the Department of Government Efficiency, but it is far from efficient in its plans to cut up to 25% of the IRS staff which include significant cuts to the staff of the IRS Criminal Investigations unit.\\n\\nThe Criminal Investigation unit of the IRS plays an essential role in combating drug and human trafficking, terrorism, tax crimes, financial crimes and money laundering.\\n\\nThrough the Criminal Investigation Unit’s Asset and Investigative Service, it seizes assets used by criminal enterprises and then sends those forfeited funds to the Treasury Forfeiture Fund which returns funds to crime victims, reimburses law enforcement agencies for expenses incurred in conducting criminal investigations as well as share forfeited funds with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.\\n\\nAccording to its annual report, in 2024 the IRS-CI initiated more than 2,667 criminal investigations, obtaining 1,571 convictions representing a 90% conviction rate. It uncovered more than $9.1 billion in fraud from tax and financial crimes, obtained court orders totaling $1.7 billion in restitution to the IRS and seized criminal assets totaling approximately $1.2 billion far exceeding the cost of its budget.\\n\\nIn addition, in the Fall of 2024 the IRS-CI increased its efforts against wealthy tax cheats with actions against 1,600 taxpayers earning more than a million dollars a year which by July of 2024 had already brought in $1 billion in collections.\\n\\nAccording to a study at the University of Michigan the top .5% of the highest earning Americans account for about a fifth of the income that is hidden from the IRS estimated to be more than $50 billion. Efforts by DOGE to reduce the CI’s efforts to collect taxes owed by the very wealthy appear to be extremely shortsighted.\\n\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n\\nMicrosoft Warns 240 Million Windows Users—Stop Using Your PC\\n\\n‘NYT Mini’ Clues And Answers For Saturday, April 5\\n\\nTrump Tells Americans To 'Hang Tough' After Liberation Day Tariffs Wipe Trillions From Stock Market\\n\\nIRS-CI has also played a major part in criminal actions against drug cartels, which are a major focus of the present administration which makes DOGE’s efforts to reduce their staff all the more confusing.\\n\\nAs noted in a letter from Senators Ron Wyden, Chuck Schumer and seven Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee:\\n\\n“IRS Criminal Investigation is at the forefront of federal law enforcement efforts to investigate fentanyl trafficking by cartels, human trafficking, terrorism financing, and sanctions evasion. For example, CI was the lead investigative agency in the largest international fentanyl/opioid seizure in U.S. history. This operation took down a massive drug trafficking operation and seized 864 kg of drugs, including an astounding 64kg of fentanyl and fentanyl-laced opioids, enough to kill thousands of people. CI was also responsible for the dismantling of several large fentanyl trafficking networks operated by the Sinaloa cartel, including a collaboration with Chinese money laundering organizations. An indefinite hiring freeze at CI would endanger both public safety and national security by directly hampering multi-agency efforts to pursue and dismantle thee highly dangerous criminal networks.”\\n\\nCutting staff and funding from an efficient government agency that returns far more than it costs makes no sense and leaves the country more vulnerable to criminal enterprises and encourages tax cheating.\\n\\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades\", category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-05 20:01:01', authors=['Contributor', 'Kayla Bartkowski', 'Steve Weisman']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='The popularity of Adolescence has provided an icebreaker for these conversations, but having them is not a responsibility women can shoulder\\n\\n“The fitness coach starts his very early morning routine by removing a piece of tape from his mouth,” CNN reports.

We had a good run as a species for a while, didn’t we? Although it is slightly embarrassing we had less time on Earth than a bunch of giant lizards that never even invented the internet.\\n\\nI’m so old that I remember when the definition of masculinity was taking responsibility for yourself and others around you. Chainsaw-wielding billionaires like Elon Musk and his president-of-somewhere sidekick, Donald, are most insistent on their role as champions of Western Civilisation™, so I wondered how they missed the instruction that one should “not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment”. These are the words of the Apostle Paul in the Bible, so I guess the source is pretty niche.\\n\\nHow great that Maga identities have Project 2025 to explain to them the gender roles they’re so rigorously policing. Should we be concerned that the campaign to politically erase trans people – so en vogue both in America and among America’s political lemmings in the Australian right – is a symptom of their endgame of reducing “men” and “women” to binary 1950s stereotypes that didn’t even reflect the reality of their time? Yes. Obviously, my brain works different because I was raised a girl; studies suggest I am therefore more likely to be burdened with evidence-based research and scholarship. That’s how you discover that before the postwar baby boom, a consistent 20% of western women lived child free, and – even during the boom, in the 50s – 47% of married American women also held down jobs.\\n\\nAs a feminist, I yearn for those ancient sunny days of … 2019, when we merely worried that young men were consuming so much misogynist porn their junk had stopped working. I miss being concerned that Tucker Carlson was influencing men to shove their dicks in a toaster – three years and at least three Andrew-Tate-rape-allegations ago.\\n\\nTate is a manfluencer who once had nearly 5 million Instagram followers himself before achieving the unimaginable and actually getting kicked off the platform for hate speech. The former professional kickboxer denies all allegations of violence that have brought him legal trouble. “All of it is a lie,” he said of an ex-girlfriend who accused him this week of choking and beating her.\\n\\nHe doesn’t deny calling women “a man’s property”, of course. Or claiming girls are out to “steal [men’s] power” – that’s in his book “The Tate Bible II: The New Testament”. Stick that up your apostle, Paul. Confronted with similar proselytised woman-hating in the classroom, Australia “risks losing a generation of school leaders without urgent reforms”, a world-leading educational psychologist said this week, in a story about primary school principals referred to as “bitch dogs”, slut-shamed and threatened with having their throats slit.\\n\\nOne can stay in a comforting bubble of ignorance, or instead choose to read newspapers, watch the critically acclaimed TV drama series Adolescence, or – God help you – pretend to be a feminist on Elon’s bespoke propaganda channel X for five entire minutes to see the extent of the problem. To explain it, you could consider that in the monetised attention economy of the internet, extremity is incentivised, that grifters gonna grift and a lot of money from rightwing gender-binary fantasists has been funding this hot, hateful garbage for years.\\n\\nYou could also claim that a generation of gen-X men who are now parents have, perhaps, abrogated conversations about manhood and sexuality they might feel cringe or squeamish about having to an online cult of male toxic nutjobs more than eager to instruct their sons for them. It’s extraordinary that the heterosexual western gen-X men who reaped the economic rewards of dual incomes and planned parenthoods, the pleasure of liberated sexuality and the instant social status gain of knowing how to bring a woman to orgasm – to actual orgasm, not the mimicking of poses and sounds from porn girls have been culturally coerced to watch – would not share these insights with the generations that follow them.\\n\\nThe popularity of Adolescence has provided an icebreaker for these conversations, but having them is not a responsibility women can shoulder towards boys who’ve already been convinced that we’re “bitch dogs” by the time they go to freakin’ primary school.\\n\\nYou know the internet’s a lie. You know the life offered by the manfluencers is angry, unhappy and unloving. But I say this to the men of my own generation: if you don’t find the strength to inoculate the boys against it … what men are left?\\n\\n Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist', category=None, publish_date='2025-04-05 20:00:30', authors=['Van Badham']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='More than 1,200 \"Hands Off!\" demonstrations were planned by more than 150 groups.', image='https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/04/05/276415c9-5a9b-4054-ab29-9974b3a9ee90/thumbnail/1200x630/ff348cef31bb0f111e9f95188689a0ed/gettyimages-2208673889.jpg?v=7613930c2bdb7d1bf55be910a9b022f2', sentiment=0.323, language='en', video='https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3659400_hls/master.m3u8', title='\"Hands Off!\" demonstrations protest Trump, Musk across U.S.', url='https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-musk-hands-off-demonstrators-protest/', source_country='us', id=308078394, text='Opponents of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk rallied across the U.S. on Saturday to protest the administration\\'s actions on government downsizing, the economy, human rights and other issues.More than 1,200 \"Hands Off!\" demonstrations were planned by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, LBGTQ+ advocates, veterans and elections activists.

And while that may seem like a really bizarre thing to do to a senior official who’s supposed to be conducting crucial government work, it’s just another footnote in America’s rapid descent into fascism.\\n\\nFEMA acting Administrator Cameron Hamilton was given the lie detector test after he had a meeting on March 25 with Kristi Noem, the former governor of South Dakota and current Secretary of Homeland Security. Also in the meeting, according to Politico, was Corey Lewandowski, an adviser to President Donald Trump who’s reportedly working as a “special government employee,” not unlike Elon Musk. The disclosure of the meeting, reported by CNN on March 26, was apparently considered a betrayal.\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security appeared to confirm that the lie detector test took place in a statement to Politico, warning that “leakers” would be prosecuted. But the result of the lie detector test wasn’t exactly clear.\\n\\n“Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, DHS is unapologetic about its efforts to root out leakers that undermine national security. We are agnostic about your standing, tenure, political appointment or status as a career civil servant—we will track down leakers and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law,” a DHS spokesperson told Politico.\\n\\nPresident Trump has not nominated a permanent FEMA administrator, and Hamilton is a former Navy SEAL who has worked in the federal government for the past decade, including at the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department. As the New York Times pointed out when Hamilton was appointed to the role shortly after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, Hamilton was considered an odd choice for the head of FEMA given his lack of experience in disaster response.\\n\\nThe news about DHS lie detector tests comes as FEMA is in hot water over withholding financial assistance to “blue” states, or those that voted for Democrats in the 2024 election. A federal judge ordered a halt to federal funding freezes by FEMA that were holding back money to at least 19 states. And on Friday, that judge ruled that the order had been violated. What happens after that? It appears the judge hasn’t found the Trump regime lawyers in contempt yet, so nothing happens. At this point, the judge has just issued another order, telling them to obey the previous order.\\n\\nAnd that seems to speak to the asymmetry right now happening with the rule of law on one side and the Trump regime on the other. These folks are sending U.S. residents to El Salvador without trial and making top officials take lie detector tests. Then you have judges doing little more than saying “Pretty please obey our orders.” It’s not great.', category=None, publish_date='2025-04-05 19:45:33', authors=['Matt Novak']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary=\"Protesters across the US rallied against Donald Trump's policies on Saturday.

That was until a federally funded research program led to the creation of a drug that increased her chances by more than four times. \\n\\nAs she watches federal funding for medical research, cancer drugs like the one that saved her life included, Brandon, now in her 50s, can’t help but be distraught. \\n\\nShe was among the thousands who took to Daley Plaza Saturday, later marching down LaSalle Street and then up to State Street, at a “Hands Off” protest organized by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, Indivisible Chicago, Equality Illinois, the Chicago Federation of Labor and others. Organizers said more than 30,000 people marched Saturday to rally against Trump and billionaire CEO Elon Musk. At its peak, the protest spanned at least eight city blocks. \\n\\nIt was one of more than 1,200 “Hands Off!” demonstrations planned by more than 150 groups in all 50 states, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, LBGTQ+ advocates, veterans and elections activists. Several were also planned in the suburbs, many in Democratic strongholds outside the city, including Joliet, Rockford, Highland Park, Lisle and others.\\n\\nThe protests took aim at Trump’s recent policy actions that have hit home in Illinois, including: the firing of thousands of federal workers, raids targeting legal citizens and immigrants, attempts to remove protections for transgender people and federal funding cuts to local health programs, medical research and city arts programs — in addition to worries over changes to Social Security. The administration has also slashed jobs overseeing the Head Start program, leaving about 28,000 children in Illinois alone — as well as their parents and caretakers — in limbo while making significant cuts to the Department of Education.\\n\\nTrump’s recently announced tariffs against major U.S. trade partners roiled the stock market, which took its worst tumble since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and sparked a global trade war.\\n\\n“In just a few short months, Donald Trump and Elon Musk have slashed thousands of jobs, gutted worker protections and destabilized the entire economy,” said Bob Reiter, president of the Chicago Federation of Labor. “We will not allow Trump and Musk to loot our government and shred our economy for their own personal gain, and we will not sit by while they destroy critical services and the dedicated workers who provide them.”\\n\\nBeing at Saturday’s protest was personal for Brandon. “I wouldn’t be here without federal funding for cancer research,” Brandon said. \\n\\nBrandon is facing the brunt of Trump’s decision on multiple fronts. Her husband, an EPA worker in Chicago, has been spared from recent cuts at the agency but fears for the future as they see their retirement investments dwindle. She works for the Cook County Forest Preserves, which also receives federal funding, particularly for youth job programs and cleanup projects. \\n\\n“If that money dries up, it just hurts local people,” she said.\\n\\nContributing: AP', category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-05 19:33:50', authors=['Violet Miller']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='More than 1,200 “Hands Off!” demonstrations were planned by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations and labor unions.', image='https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a412ea8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3337x1752+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8c%2Ff9%2Fe6d2620140cdacf29a83efa757e1%2Fap25095648730878.jpg', sentiment=0.282, language='en', video=None, title=\"Protesters rally against Trump and Musk in 'Hands Off!' rallies across the US\", url='https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/president-trumps-first-100-days/protesters-rally-against-trump-and-musk-in-hands-off-rallies-across-the-us', source_country='us', id=308084192, text='Opponents of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk rallied across the U.S. on Saturday to protest the administration\\'s actions on government downsizing, the economy, human rights and other issues.More than 1,200 “Hands Off!” demonstrations were planned by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, LBGTQ+ advocates, veterans and elections activists.

He says he is saving taxpayers billions of dollars.Speaking at the Washington protest, Paul Osadebe, a lawyer for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and a labor union steward, criticized Trump, Musk and others in the administration for not valuing the work federal employees do in creating “a baseline of economic security and power for working people.”“Billionaires and oligarchs don\\'t value anything other than profit and power, and they sure as hell don\\'t value you or your life or your community,” he said. “And we\\'re seeing that they don\\'t care who they have to destroy or who they have to hurt to get what they want.”In Massachusetts, thousands of people gathered on Boston Common holding signs including “Hands off our democracy,” “Hands off our Social Security” and “Diversity equity inclusion makes America strong.

They have been given 10 days to show a willingness to comply with the Trump administration’s executive orders, and will then be informed as to whether the family planning funding will be permanently stripped or reinstated.\\n\\nAccording to Politico, “The notice pointed to ‘possible violations’ of federal civil rights law and President Donald Trump’s executive orders — including prohibitions on promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion and ‘taxpayer subsidization of open borders.’” HHS is reportedly withholding these funds from seven other providers aside from the nine Planned Parenthood affiliates — 16 providers in all.\\n\\nPolitico reported:\\n\\n Clare Coleman, the CEO of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, which represents most Title X providers, said in an interview that medical groups in the program are being penalized for following the rules. \\n\\nThe groups applied for the money under the Biden administration, when “health equity was a core priority,” and before Trump was sworn in or signed any executive orders, she said. \\n\\nAnd in those applications, many stressed a commitment to diversity for which they’re now being penalized.\\n\\nUnder Trump’s first administration, Planned Parenthood was stripped of its Title X funding under the “Protect Life Rule,” which required organizations receiving family planning federal dollars to keep their family planning services separate, both physically and fiscally, from their abortion business. The organizations were also restricted from referring for abortions. The Biden administration disbanded that rule; it remains to be seen whether the current Trump administration is planning to reinstate the Protect Life Rule.\\n\\nAlexis McGill Johnson, the current president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, said in a statement that being deprived of this funding will put women’s lives at risk. “President Trump and Elon Musk are pushing their dangerous political agenda, stripping health care access from people nationwide, and not giving a second thought to the devastation they will cause,” she said.\\n\\nYet Planned Parenthood serves just 2% of American women of reproductive age, and annual reports regularly show that Planned Parenthood’s legitimate health care services have plummeted even as the corporation’s abortion numbers have hit record highs.\\n\\nSince the year 2000, Planned Parenthood has committed over 7.1 million abortions and currently commits an average of more than 1,000 abortions every single day. Sixty-two (62) abortions are committed at Planned Parenthood for every one woman who receives prenatal care, and it has become an industry leader in “gender affirming care,” offering “hormone replacement, puberty blockers, and even surgery referrals” to a reported “1 in 6 U.S. teens and young adults who sought gender hormones” in 2023, according to insurance data. Planned Parenthood has repeatedly failed to report instances of child sexual abuse and trafficking — and yet, the corporation’s most recent annual report reveals that it received nearly $700 million in taxpayer funding in just that year.\\n\\n[Editor’s note: This story originally was published by Live Action News.]', category='politics', publish_date='2025-04-05 19:01:40', authors=['Live Action News']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='One day, Americans are being hit with President Donald Trump’s dreams of annexing Greenland, and the next, the U.S. government is creating a global trade war.

They all failed, though a GOP amendment to protect Medicare and Medicaid was accepted.\\n\\nDemocrats accused Republicans of laying the groundwork for cutting key safety net programs to help pay for more than $5 trillion tax cuts they say disproportionately benefit the rich.\\n\\n“Trump’s policies are a disaster,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, as is Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, he added. “Republicans could snuff it out tonight, if they wanted.”\\n\\nThe Republicans framed their work as preventing a tax increase for most American families, arguing that unless Congress acts, the individual and estate tax cuts that GOP lawmakers passed in 2017 will expire at the end of this year.\\n\\nThe Senate package pulls in other GOP priorities, including $175 billion to bolster Trump’s mass deportation effort, which is running short of cash, and an additional $175 billion for the Pentagon to build up the military, from an earlier budget effort.\\n\\nWyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 ranking Republican, said voters gave his party a mission in November, and the Senate’s budget plan delivers.\\n\\n“It fulfills our promises to secure the border, to rebuild our economy and to restore peace through strength,” Barrasso said.\\n\\nThe framework now goes to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., could bring it up for a vote as soon as next week as he works toward a final product by Memorial Day.\\n\\nThe House and Senate need to resolve their differences. The House’s version has $4.5 trillion in tax breaks over 10 years and some $2 trillion in budget cuts, and pointed at changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other programs. Some House Republicans have panned the Senate’s approach.\\n\\nRepublican senators used their majority to swat back Democratic amendments, often in rambunctious voice votes.\\n\\nAmong the more than two dozen amendments offered were several to protect safety net programs. Several Republicans, including Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, joined Democrats in voting to preserve some of those programs, particularly regarding health care. Collins opposed the entire package in a warning against steep Medicaid cuts.\\n\\nCollins said the potential reductions for that health program in the House bill “would be very detrimental to a lot of families and disabled individuals and seniors in my state.”\\n\\nPaul questioned the math being used by his colleagues that he said would pile on the debt load. “Something’s fishy,” he said.\\n\\nOne Republican, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, expressed his own misgivings about tax breaks adding to the federal deficits and said he has assurances that Trump officials would seek the cuts elsewhere.\\n\\n“This vote isn’t taking place in a vacuum,” he said, a nod to the turmoil over Trump’s tariffs.\\n\\nOne crucial challenge ahead will be for the House to accept the way the Senate’s budget plan allows for extending the tax cuts under a scoring method that treats them as not adding to future deficits, something many House Republicans reject. A new estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation projects the tax breaks will add $5.5 trillion over the next decade when including interest, and $4.6 trillion not including interest.\\n\\nOn top of that, the senators added an additional $1.5 trillion that would allow some of Trump’s campaign promises, such as no taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime, swelling the overall the price tag to $7 trillion.\\n\\nRepublicans are also looking to increase the $10,000 deduction for state and local taxes, something that lawmakers from states such as New York, California and New Jersey say is necessary for their support.\\n\\nThe House and Senate are also at odds over increasing the debt limit to allow more borrowing. The House had boosted the debt limit by $4 trillion in its plan, but the Senate upped it to $5 trillion to push any further votes on the matter until after next year’s midterm elections.\\n\\nThe Senate calls for just $4 billion in spending cuts, but GOP leadership emphasizes that’s a low floor and that committees will be on the hunt for far more.\\n\\nAlready, the GOP leaders are confronting concerns from fiscal hawks who want trillions of dollars in spending cuts to help pay for the tax breaks. At the same time, dozens of lawmakers in swing districts and states are worried about what those cuts will mean for their constituents, and for their reelection chances.\\n\\nThe GOP leadership has encouraged members to just get a budget plan over the finish line, saying they have time to work out the tough questions of which tax breaks and spending cuts to include.\\n\\nExtending the the 2017 breaks would cut taxes for about three-quarters of households but raise them for about 10%. In 2027, about 45% of the benefit of all the tax cuts would go to those making roughly $450,000 or more, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, which analyzes tax issues.\\n\\nBy Lisa Mascaro, Leah Askarinam and Kevin Freking of the Associated Press.', category=None, publish_date='2025-04-05 18:56:34', authors=['The Associated Press']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='Internewscast Journal\\n\\nInternewscast\\n\\n\\nCHICAGO (WLS) &#8212; Opponents of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are&#8230;\\n\\n\\nThis Post: Protesters in Chicago and Surrounding Areas Rally Against Donald Trump and Elon Musk first appeared on Internewscast Journal', image='https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png', sentiment=-0.055, language='en', video=None, title='Protesters in Chicago and Surrounding Areas Rally Against Donald Trump and Elon Musk', url='https://internewscast.com/news/us/protesters-in-chicago-and-surrounding-areas-rally-against-donald-trump-and-elon-musk/', source_country='us', id=308067212, text='CHICAGO (WLS) — Opponents of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are rallying across the Chicago area on Saturday to protest the administration and its actions.\\n\\nMore than 1,200 “Hands Off!” demonstrations were planned by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, LBGTQ+ advocates, veterans and elections activists across the country.\\n\\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7.

Trump said in a February Fox News interview that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits, will not be \"touched\" unless \"there\\'s fraud or something.\"The protests are taking place just days after Trump\\'s global sweeping tariffs which have rattled global and domestic markets, with Wall Street tanking over the past few days, marking the worst days for the U.S. stock markets since 2020.Hundreds of people in European cities—including Frankfurt, Berlin, London, Lisbon and Paris—took to the streets in solidarity with American protests, highlighting the global impact of Trump\\'s policies.

Musk, who has spearheaded efforts for mass layoffs and federal cuts in his DOGE leadership role, is the CEO of Tesla. The electric vehicle brand has faced violent attacks and vandalism around the world in response to Musk\\'s political activity. In the U.S., the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) is treating such attacks as domestic terrorism.Sales in the European Union (EU) of vehicles made by Tesla plummeted by 49 percent year-on-year in the first two months of 2025, industry group The European Automobile Manufacturers\\' Association (ACEA) said.In Frankfurt, Democrats Abroad, the official Democratic Party arm for Americans living outside the country, organized a protest, with participants holding signs calling to \"Restore Democracy.\"Newsweek has reached out to Democrats Abroad for comment via email on Saturday.Hundreds of people have RSVP\\'d for various \"Hands Off!\" events organized by Democrats Abroad across France, including in Nice, Lyon, Paris and Toulouse, according to their website.European cities have protested Trump before, as have their leaders.

He says he is saving taxpayers billions of dollars.\\n\\nA promoter of the event wrote in a press release that the event “aims to peacefully bring together the people of Mass. to march in support of our cities and communities being sanctuaries against tyranny.”\\n\\nIt’s one of more than 1,000 events, according to “Hands Off” promoters, taking place across the country on Saturday “in defiance of the Trump-Musk billionaire takeover and the Republican assault on our freedoms and our communities.”\\n\\nSpeakers at Boston’s event include Sen. Ed Markey, American Federation of Teachers state President Jessica Tang, ACLU state President Carol Rose and founder of Trans Resistance Chastity Bowick.

This update is just one more of the billionaire’s audacious projects, following in the footsteps of his ventures with reusable rockets, brain-computer interfaces, and the ever-so-slightly alarming proposal to establish a human settlement on Mars.\\n\\nThe rate of improvement is indeed rapid.\\nThere will be a legion of Optimus robots this year. https://t.co/wANpmbuwN8\\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 2, 2025\\n\\nThe post swiftly spread like wildfire, not just because of what it suggested but also because it was just so weird to call them a “legion.” That’s a term we usually save for armies, not friendly robot-like beings that help us out. But what on earth are these bots, really? Is this the start of the robot rebellion everyone’s been talking about for ages?\\n\\nThe Optimus robot, which made its public debut in the year 2021, is a human-like invention by Tesla that’s designed to assist humans with all those mundane tasks that can be such a chore, such as carrying in the groceries or folding a huge pile of laundry. The mastermind behind Tesla, has spoken about how it’s been designed to do “repetitive, boring, or dangerous tasks.”\\n\\nFast forward to early 2025, and the Optimus robot has come a long way. It’s been shown in some Tesla factory clips doing things like walking around and knowing what objects are. It’s also gotten better at using its hands, which is a big deal for a machine that’s supposed to lend a hand around the house.\\n\\nAt an event in 2023 where Tesla had to show off their tech, Musk said that this robot helper would cost lower than you might think, “less than $20,000”. He’s expecting that in a few more years, these robotic pals will be common in households. The idea is that Optimus will be the first of its kind that people can buy and use in their everyday lives.\\n\\nBut, just like any new gizmo, some folks aren’t entirely convinced yet. They argue that while it’s impressive, it’s still more of an early model than a polished product ready for everyone’s home.\\n\\nNaturally, Musk’s dramatic revelation set off a storm of humor on the internet. A person on X playfully asked, “Is this a declaration of war?” which led to a flood of memes imagining futures from movies like I, Robot, and Terminator, filled with machines ruling over us. Another user, perhaps more grounded in reality, posted, “Can it fold my laundry and put it away?” This question showed the realistic expectations some people have from such advanced technology—helping with everyday chores.\\n\\nSomeone else joked, “My next pet will be an Optimus,” poking fun at the robot’s name while hinting at the potential companionship humans might seek from these mechanical creations. Meanwhile, a different user had a more action-packed request, asking, “Can it grapple and do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?” aka a reference to Musk’s interest in martial arts.\\n\\nAs user @_JohnnyJones humorously warned, “Prepare yourselves!” It’s evident that the online community is amused, doubtful, and scared about what these robots might bring to the table.\\n\\nAccording to an article from Wired in January 2025, Tesla’s work on the Optimus robot is moving ahead of what people thought possible. But, as of right now, these robots are “not ready to make breakfast or babysit your kids anytime soon,” as Dr. Lisa Wang, an expert in robotics from MIT, explained to TechCrunch.\\n\\nHowever, looking at how things often turn out with Musk’s projects, something that seems like science fiction today could be a common sight tomorrow. Take Tesla’s Full Self-Driving feature, for example. Some can’t imagine their lives without it now.\\n\\nTesla Full Self-Driving capability demo in Austin\\nFSD capability features use vision neural networks to perceive & understand the world, just like humans do.\\nVia our unique fleet learning approach, we are able to collect anonymized data from our vehicles—meaning the neural… pic.twitter.com/CWAS5h0jGH\\n— Tesla (@Tesla) October 17, 2023\\n\\nWhile Tesla hasn’t started letting everyone reserve one of these robots yet, the company is working hard to get early models into some factories and homes by the end of 2025. Some in the know say a wider release for testing might happen in 2026.\\n\\nIn the meantime, it’s a safe bet that Musk will keep posting, the robots will keep getting smarter, and the internet will keep coming up with memes about them.', category=None, publish_date='2025-04-05 17:26:42', authors=['Sohini']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='The world economy is reeling today as businesses and investors try to unpack Donald Trump\\'s so-called \"reciprocal tariffs.\" Trump aims to curb the United States\\' reliance on foreign goods by raising the tax rate for different countries, throwing the US-dominated global supply chain into chaos.

Wall Street is in shambles as a result, with some $5 trillion in market value being wiped out in the past two days — the worst performance for the S&P 500 since the pandemic shock of 2020.\\n\\nTech stocks were hammered especially hard after China announced its own tariffs of 34 percent in response to Trump\\'s moves, thanks to their dependence on Chinese minerals and labor. And of all the tech companies bleeding out on the Stock Exchange floor, Tesla is in particularly rough shape.\\n\\nElon Musk\\'s EV company posted losses for ten of the last 11 weeks, and this one was no different. On Friday, Tesla\\'s stock plummeted almost immediately after China announced its return volley, and continued to fall throughout the day to the tune of a 10 percent drop. Overall, Tesla\\'s stock value has fallen by nearly 44 percent since Trump took office.\\n\\nThat\\'s before you even mention Tesla\\'s dismal quarterly sales results, which came in lower than even the worst estimates at a three-year low. Analysts are now predicting a second straight year of sales decline for Tesla, which is bad news for Tesla\\'s long term outlook.\\n\\nIt\\'s all coming together to threaten Tesla\\'s status as a \"growth stock,\" an iron-clad company like Alphabet or Apple whose financial growth is seen as all but guaranteed. Of course, that future depends on a healthy and confident stock market, which we probably won\\'t see again for a while, as all signs point toward a recession.\\n\\nMusk\\'s personal fortune, which is tightly connected to Tesla, likewise took a plunge. Thanks to Trump\\'s tariffs, his massive hoard of riches shed some $11 billion, for a 2.5 percent loss. Forbes had previously reported in March that Musk\\'s net worth was down by $104 billion since Trump took office on January 20th, a number that these tariffs might soon look like chump change as countries cancel Starlink contracts and the European Union prepares its own retaliatory measures.\\n\\nAs the world braces for further economic fallout in the weeks to come, it’s clear that Trump’s tariffs may have set off a chain reaction that could reshape global markets — and Musk’s EV empire — forever.\\n\\nMore on Tesla: Government Seeking Wild Punishment for Man Accused of Vandalizing Tesla Dealership', category=None, publish_date='2025-04-05 17:25:11', authors=['Joe Wilkins']), SearchNews200ResponseNewsInner(summary='All around the United States. anti-Trump demonstrations called the Hands Off protests are taking place.', image='https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2208026713_f22b0c-e1743872415836.jpeg?fit=6720%2C3796', sentiment=-0.016, language='en', video=None, title='What Are the Hands Off Protests About?
